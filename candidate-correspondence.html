					<h1>Responses from London Elections Candidates 2024</h1>

					<div class="w3-panel">
						<p>
							Save Our Safer Streets wrote to the main candidates for mayor and local and London-wide
							assembly
							members and asked them to agree to three pledges:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>To support LTNs in principle, if they are subject to robust engagement and consultation,
								implemented well and the monitoring data shows that they are succeeding in their
								objectives;
							</li>
							<li>To encourage the Mayor of London to work with boroughs to roll out more LTNs and
								intervene
								if there are proposals to remove successful LTNs so that TfL money isn’t wasted and the
								London transport plan isn’t put at risk;</li>
							<li>To push for your national party to include a pledge in their next election manifesto to
								fund
								more LTNs and reinstate the national guidance hastily withdrawn by Rishi Sunak so that
								there
								is a presumption for retaining LTNs in order to protect public health and avoid public
								money
								being wasted.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							The responses we've received as of April 29 2024 are below.
						</p>
						<p>
							We're pleased to say that many of the candidates standing for elections are supporting our
							aims
							and have policies that will help make our streets safer, with cleaner air.

							<p>
								<em>Hello,</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Thank you for contacting me about low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs).

								</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>
									As you know, local councils are responsible for traffic on their roads, including
									implementing measures such as LTNs. I recognise that LTNs were intended to make
									residential
									streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists, notably by restricting cars and vans
									from
									using
									them as shortcuts. However, I also recognise that there has been concern that some
									LTNs
									are
									overly restrictive and/or or do not meet the needs of local people.

								</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>
									With this in mind, I welcome the draft statutory guidance the Government has
									published
									for
									councils, setting out that they must gain buy-in from local residents, businesses
									and
									emergency services when considering implementing new LTN schemes.

								</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>
									It is worth highlighting that a recent review suggested only 13% of people have
									responded to
									councils' planning consultations on LTNs, and just 18% feel that their views have
									influenced
									council decisions. As such, I see the new guidance as a positive step in terms of
									making
									sure councils engage local people before significant changes are made.

								</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>

									Thank you again for taking the time to contact me.
									<br><br>
									Thanks,
									<br><br>
									Freddie Downing<br>
									<strong>Conservative Candidate for City and East<br>
										London Assembly Elections 2024

								Good morning, <br><br>
								I'm responding to the below email on behalf of Patrick Stillman (CC'ed), our City & East
								GLA
								candidate. Put simply, we're very happy to support the pledges that you have made
								regarding
								LTNs.<br><br>
								I'd also like to mention that we really appreciate the wording of the first pledge - one
								thing that we think is so important is that consultations are genuine exercises,
								involving
								officers and councillors talking to residents and working out the best model, rather
								than
								simply a box ticking exercise.<br><br>
								We know some residents are going to be resistant to any changes, but it's our belief
								that
								through proper consultation we can not only ensure that any LTN is well designed but
								that we
								also bring more residents with us and achieve more of a consensus.<br><br>
								I'd also like to flag support we've previously given to your campaign on social media:
								<a

								Many thanks,<br>

						<blockquote>
							<em>
								Good morning! <br><br>


								Thanks for reaching out to us, <br><br>
								It's great to hear how successful your campaign has been so far. <br><br>


								As you know there is a lot of work to do in making our streets safer in terms of both
								air pollution and general road safety. <br><br>
								Measures which reduce car dependency and promote public and active transport are the way
								forward, and LTNs and other safe road layouts that prioritise safety are a core part of
								this as well as having other benefits to the community, the urban fabric, and local
								businesses. <br><br>


								Our campaign is fully in support of the measures you have advocated for and I will
								gladly pledge support to these measures. <br><br>


								Either a Green mayor or more Greens on the Assembly will help ensure we put the safety
								of our communities first. <br><br>


								All the best, <br>
								Joe <br><br>


								Joe Hudson-Small <br>
								Candidate for City and East London Assembly Constituency

						<blockquote>
							<em>I absolutely support all your pledges. My voting record is clear on my support for
								traffic reduction, clean air and the need for well designed LTNS (alongside
								consultation) and I'm delighted that your campaign is doing so much to promote more of
								this work - and tackle some of the awful culture war misinformation.<br><br>


								Thank you and very happy to support!<br><br>


								Zack Polanski AM<br>
								(Green London Assembly Member)

						<hr>
						<blockquote>
							<em>
								Hello!<br><br>

								I'm writing to voice my support for LTNs, and the need to defend our existing ones and
								expand into more communities.<br><br>
								I saw firsthand the positive impact LTNs have had for Highbury. More playing in the
								street. Cleaner air. More walking and cycling. A renaissance for our local high
								street.<br><br>
								I back all three of your asks wholeheartedly<br><br>
								Cllr Benali Hamdache
