								We at Save Our Safer Streets campaign are challenging the new Tower Hamlets
								Mayor and Council to publish local data on emergency service response times, air
								quality and traffic congestion. This is after
								<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/you-asked">our own analysis</a> has shown that the
								new street designs in Bethnal Green have had a far more positive impact than the
								mayor and others have claimed.
							</b>
						</p>
						<p class="w3-large">
							<b>Our analysis, using FoIs and public domain data, has shown that:</b>
						</p>
						<ul class="w3-large">
							<li>
								<b>There has been
									<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/fire">NO increase in fire service response
										times</a></b>
								since the installation of the new road layouts and Low Traffic Neighbourhood
								(LTN) schemes. This is both across Tower Hamlets as a whole and for the five
								wards where they have been installed.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>There has been
									<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/ambulance">NO increase in ambulance response
										times</a></b>
								attributable to the LTN schemes in Bethnal Green. Category 1 response times
								remain stable in E2 after the installation of LTNs, and Category 2 response
								times in the E2 LTN areas are comparable with Tower Hamlets as a whole.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>There has been
									<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/boundary">NO increase in journey times on boundary
										roads attributable to the LTNs</a></b>
								- journey times have increased on all roads at a similar rate. Eastbound
								journeys on Hackney Road have increased by 30 seconds at most, but this is
								likely to have several causes such as repeated roadworks and LTNs in
								neighbouring Hackney.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b><a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/air">Air quality is now dramatically better</a>
									across all of Tower Hamlets than it was in 2019</b>, and from 2021, annual average
								pollution levels in Tower Hamlets have fallen
								below the national target. These falls are matched in areas surrounding and
								including LTNs.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="w3-large">
							We are publishing our analysis today on our
							<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/you-asked">website</a> and have presented some of
							it in a ‘look-up’ format where residents can find further details and analysis
							on emergency response times, air quality and traffic congestion.
						</p>
						<p class="w3-large">
							We’re also highlighting
							<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/transport">a letter to the mayor from Transport for London
								(TfL)</a>, in which it objects to the council’s plans to remove the current schemes and
							said the council’s consultation did not provide enough evaluation to support its
							proposals. TfL also says its plan to put in a new bus lane in Hackney Road
							cannot go ahead if Tower Hamlets council rips out the street design in Old
							Bethnal Green Road. Our petition on the council’s website to save the scheme and
							improve it instead of ripping it out closed with 3,094 signatures (the second
							highest for any TH e-petition).
						</p>
						<p class="w3-large">
							We conducted the research in response to the mayor and others repeatedly
							claiming that the LTN schemes have made traffic and journey times worse on
							boundary roads, and using these claims as an argument for getting rid of them.
							For example, the
							<a href="https://talk.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lsbethnalgreen" target="_blank">recent
								consultation</a>
							stated that “congestion on Hackney Road and Bethnal Green Road (has) increased,”
							and in his statement of 28 September the mayor claimed that the LTNs were
							“simply moving congestion and pollution onto the most vulnerable residents”.
						</p>
						<p class="w3-large">
							But no data has yet been published to show that this is true, and the data we
							are publishing today suggests that these statements are at odds with the facts.
							We are asking the council to conduct its own funded and verified analysis to
							provide the public with the evidence they need to make informed choices.
						</p>
						<p class="w3-large">
							Jane Harris, a Tower Hamlets resident who is involved with Save Our Safer
							Streets, said: “We want the mayor’s decision about the future design of our
							streets to be based on reality, not arguments he can’t back up. The LTNs have
							brought huge improvements to so many people’s lives and so far the council
							hasn’t shown us any evidence that they are not working.
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							“If there’s no evidence of negative impacts on emergency service response times,
							congestion and air quality, ‘reopening the roads’ becomes a matter of personal
							preference and convenience for motorists,” she continued. “Given his pledge to
							be a mayor for all people, we would hope the mayor would weigh this carefully
							against improved safety, the needs of the whole community and the wider climate
							crisis. “It always takes time to get used to change,” Jane said. “There may be
							improvements that can be made to the street schemes which address residents’
							concerns, but ripping out the entire scheme without good reason would be hugely
							wasteful and unnecessarily extreme.”
						</blockquote>

						<p class="w3-large">
							The petition to ‘Save Our Safer Streets’ will be debated by Tower Hamlets
							Council on Wednesday 5 October.
