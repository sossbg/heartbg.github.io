						Tower Hamlets Council has announced a
						<a href="https://talk.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lsbethnalgreen" target="_blank">second
							consultation</a>
						to collect views on recently introduced traffic-calming, street layouts in
						Bethnal Green.
					</p>
					<p>
						This new consultation is really disappointing. It ignores results from the
						first, very similar consultation the council ran last year.
					</p>
					<p>
						Residents and businesses were clear in their support of the new layouts but the
						new consultation:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Is very one-sided, using misleading information to promote the removal of the
							new street layouts;
						</li>
						<li>
							Only offers additional improvements if residents choose the option to remove the
							new street layouts; and
						</li>
						<li>Puts forward ideas that are going to be unsafe and cost millions.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						To help break down the new consultation and explain what the options are, we've
						tried to answer a few common questions. Some of the answers below are based on
						research we have published <a href="https://heartbg.uk/you-asked.html">here</a>.

									This is the second of two consultations run by Tower Hamlets Council since the
									May 2022 elections. The council is asking residents and local businesses to
									choose one of two options.
								</p>

								<blockquote>
									“Option 1” is a proposal to reintroduce thousands more vehicle journeys per day
									through neighbourhood streets in Bethnal Green (including Old Bethnal Green
									Road, Columbia Road, Arnold Circus, Brick Lane and streets connecting them).
								</blockquote>

								<blockquote>
									“<strong>Option 2</strong>” is to retain the current street layouts in these
									areas, which have been proven to reduce through-traffic while making it safer
									for walking and cycling.

							<div class="w3-margin-bottom w3-large">
								<p>
									<strong>Option 2</strong> is the best option if you want less traffic on local
									streets and improved air quality, and more areas that are safer and friendlier
									for all. The other option, Option 1, will cost millions and will mean going back
									to square one when it comes to traffic, air quality, and safety.
								</p>

								<p>
									If there are things you’d like to change about the new street layouts, choose
									Option 2, disagree with all the option 1 proposals, and then add your thoughts
									and suggestions in the comments.

									The council have suggested some good ideas in the option they are promoting. For

									However, there’s no reason why these ideas can’t be introduced now. We can have
									reduced traffic, better air quality and safer streets, and also make our
									pavements and crossings more accessible.
								</p>

								<p>
									Again, if you see ideas you like in the proposals, choose option 2, disagree
									with all option 1 proposals, and then use the comments section to tell the

									on one consultation but two. That’s at least £140,000, equivalent to 4 times a

								<p>
									The biggest cause of delays to ambulances is road congestion. There is no
									significant difference in ambulance response times because of the new street
									layouts. The Royal London and Barts Hospital have said they want the layouts to
									stay because they know people are healthier with these kinds of streets and they
									reduce accidents. The ambulance and fire service have asked for some small
									changes like the removal of hard closures, which could be addressed by the use
									of ANPR cameras rather than the removal of the closures in their entirety.

							<div class="w3-margin-bottom w3-large">
								<p>
									Congestion on Hackney Road has been worse since the pandemic. However, it’s
									wrong to assert as the council does that the Bethnal Green scheme has caused the
									congestion on Hackney Road. Neighbouring Hackney council has made lots of
									changes on the North side of Hackney road that have likely contributed to
									current levels of congestion. Adding thousands more vehicle journeys per day
									through neighbourhood streets in Bethnal Green will not resolve Hackney Road’s
									problems. Unfortunately, congestion is also getting worse across Tower Hamlets
									so the congestion problem is something that needs to be addressed across the
									borough.

									The best solution would be to put in a bus lane. Transport for London (TFL) have
									said they can only do this if Tower Hamlets council keeps the Bethnal Green
									street layouts. TFL believe this will offer cyclists an alternative, safer route
									(see <a href="https://heartbg.uk/news.html#post_24">this report</a> of a letter

									current layouts to stay because of this. Arnold Circus in particular has much
									less anti-social behaviour and feels much safer and quieter. The millions it

								<p>
									The new street layouts are benefiting everyone, providing cleaner air, safer
									streets and places to meet and talk with neighbours. The benefits for people
									from diverse backgrounds and who fall low in deprivation measures are an
									important part of the case for the new layouts. Census results show that Old
									Bethnal Green Road has some of the most deprived social housing estates in Tower
									Hamlets. Children at the four schools on this road are also overwhelmingly from
									nearby parts of Bethnal Green and are benefiting from cleaner air, less noise
									and safer streets to get to and from school. Most poorer people don’t own cars
									because it’s so expensive. Only ⅓ of households have access to a car in the
									borough.

									The current layouts let everyone use cars when they need to. It also gives
									people safe, quiet routes to walk and cycle. This keeps the roads less congested
									and the air healthier. If there are specific problems, we need to persuade the
									council to solve these. The answer is solutions like cameras, controlled access
									roads and resident permits, not spending millions ripping out what is good.
