							to collect views on recently introduced traffic-calming, street layouts in
							Bethnal Green.
						</p>
						<p>
							This new consultation is really disappointing. It ignores results from the
							first, very similar consultation the council ran last year.
						</p>
						<p>
							Residents and businesses were clear in their support of the new layouts but the

						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Is very one-sided, using misleading information to promote the removal of the
								new street layouts;
							</li>
							<li>
								Only offers additional improvements if residents choose the option to remove the
								new street layouts; and
							</li>
							<li>Puts forward ideas that are going to be unsafe and cost millions.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							To help break down the new consultation and explain what options are, we've
							tried to answer a few common questions. Some of the answers below are based on
							research we have published <a href="https://heartbg.uk/you-asked.html">here</a>.

										This is the second of two consultations run by Tower Hamlets Council since the
										May 2022 elections. The council is asking residents and local businesses to
										choose one of two options.
									</p>

									<blockquote>
										“Option 1” is a proposal to reintroduce thousands more vehicle journeys per day
										through neighbourhood streets in Bethnal Green (including Old Bethnal Green
										Road, Columbia Road, Arnold Circus, Brick Lane and streets connecting them).
									</blockquote>

									<blockquote>
										“<strong>Option 2</strong>” is to retain the current street layouts in these

								<div class="w3-margin-bottom w3-large">
									<p>
										<strong>Option 2</strong> is the best option if you want less traffic on local
										streets and improved air quality, and more areas that are safer and friendlier
										for all. The other option, Option 1, will cost millions and will mean going back
										to square one when it comes to traffic, air quality, and safety.
									</p>

									<p>
										If there are things you’d like to change about the new street layouts, choose
										Option 2 and add your thoughts and suggestions in the comments.

										reduced traffic, better air quality and safer streets, and also make our

									<p>
										The biggest cause of delays to ambulances is road congestion. There is no
										significant difference in ambulance response times because of the new street
										layouts. The Royal London and Barts Hospital have said they want the layouts to
										stay because they know people are healthier with these kinds of streets and they
										reduce accidents. The ambulance and fire service have asked for some small
										changes like the removal of hard closures, which could be addressed by the use
										of ANPR cameras rather than the removal of the closures in their entirety.

								<div class="w3-margin-bottom w3-large">
									<p>
										Congestion on Hackney Road has been worse since the pandemic. However, it’s
										wrong to assert as the council does that the Bethnal Green scheme has caused the
										congestion on Hackney Road. Neighbouring Hackney council has made lots of
										changes on the North side of Hackney road that have likely contributed to
										current levels of congestion. Adding thousands more vehicle journeys per day
										through neighbourhood streets in Bethnal Green will not resolve Hackney Road’s
										problems. Unfortunately, congestion is also getting worse across Tower Hamlets
										so the congestion problem is something that needs to be addressed across the
										borough.

										The best solution would be to put in a bus lane. Transport for London (TFL) have
										said they can only do this if Tower Hamlets council keeps the Bethnal Green
										street layouts. TFL believe this will offer cyclists an alternative, safer route
										(see <a href="https://heartbg.uk/news.html#post_24">this report</a> of a letter

										current layouts to stay because of this. Arnold Circus in particular has much
										less anti-social behaviour and feels much safer and quieter. The millions it

										The new street layouts are benefiting everyone, providing cleaner air, safer

										Bethnal Green Road has some of the most deprived social housing estates in Tower
										Hamlets. Children at the four schools on this road are also overwhelmingly from
										nearby parts of Bethnal Green and are benefiting from cleaner air, less noise
										and safer streets to get to and from school. Most poorer people don’t own cars

										The current layouts let everyone use cars when they need to. It also gives
										people safe, quiet routes to walk and cycle. This keeps the roads less congested

										council to solve these. The answer is solutions like cameras, controlled access
										roads and resident permits, not spending millions ripping out what is good.
