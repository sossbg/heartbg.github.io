								<h4 class="w3-large w3-text-black">
									The council is consulting on a new transport strategy and we have noticed some changes that seem to be a move away from prioritising safe, clean, and sustainable travel.
								</h4>
								<p>The new strategy removes or waters down several policies that supported safer, healthier, friendlier streets. </p>
								
								<p>For example, the following plans were in the old strategy, but are missing from the new one:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Plans to create 50 school streets</li>
									<li>Plans to reduce car parking in favour of other forms of transport.</li>
									<li>Plans to make new developments car free or car lite.</li>
									<li>Acknowledgement of the need to reduce the high levels of through traffic in the borough (vital to improving air quality and road safety).</li>
									<li>Infrastructure schemes that encourage walking, wheeling, cycling and taking public transport for more journeys. These are proven to make roads safer, air cleaner and encourage people to use healthier forms of transport.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<p>If you, like us, believe that the future of transport involves supporting safer, healthier, sustainable approaches to transport, help our case by responding to the consultation.
								</p>
								<p>The consultation is here: <a href="https://talk.towerhamlets.gov.uk/transport-strategy-update">https://talk.towerhamlets.gov.uk/transport-strategy-update</a> and the deadline for responding is <strong>28th April 2025.</strong>

									Following months of hard work and a truly moving show of support from our community, we are deeply disappointed to announce that this judge hasn’t found in our favour. <strong>Please support our appeal.</strong>
								</h4>
								<p>Our Low Traffic Neighbourhoods are a major success story in a deprived area of London, virtually eliminating serious road injuries and improving air quality inside and outside the schemes. With so much support for the Low Traffic Neighbourhoods in Bethnal Green – including from schools, GPs, the Met Police, TfL and local residents – we had to do everything possible to prevent them being ripped out at a cost of millions and without listening to the people who live and work here. 
								</p>
								<p>We believed that there were serious flaws in the way the Mayor decided to remove them. We remain convinced that the Mayor of Tower Hamlets’ proposal will be expensive, unpopular, harmful for residents’ health and safety, and it will jeopardise the Mayor of London’s transport strategy.
								</p>
								<p>It’s important to note that the judge himself said that this case was not about the rights and wrongs of removing the scheme, just about whether the decision was legal. This decision has always been and still is a bad one - expensive, rushed and dangerous. We are deeply concerned about one council adopting a policy that is so at odds with what its own residents want, and with the transport policies of both regional and national governments.
								</p>
								<p>Ultimately, we still hope the Mayor of Tower Hamlets will listen to and work with residents, businesses, local schools and TfL to address the concerns we have raised about the removal of these schemes and figure out a way for us to retain their many benefits while tweaking any parts of the design that need improving. 
								</p>
								<p>So we’re not giving up.
								</p>
								<p>We are incredibly grateful to our amazing community that has enabled us to get this far and unfortunately, we have to ask for support once again.
								</p>
								<p>Our legal team has told us that there are grounds for an appeal. We hope you agree that we have to keep up this fight.
								</p>
								<p>We now have until 14 January 2025 to put in an application to the Court of Appeal.
								</p>
								<p>This application will potentially require about £30,000 more than we have already raised, if we go all the way to an appeal hearing, so <b>again</b> we need to ask for <a href="https://go.saveoursaferstreets.org/crowdfunder-wb">donations at CrowdJustice.com</a>.
								</p>
								<p>We hope people will stay with us in this vital mission to keep Londoners safer and healthier. Please donate today to save our safer streets.

									Our Judicial Review hearing concluded yesterday evening.
								</h4>
								<p>We enjoyed hearing the well-reasoned and compelling arguments of our barrister and TfL's too. It was great to hear our 2022 petition referenced, as well as the witness statements from residents and the headteacher of Oaklands School - local community matters in this case. 
								</p>
								<p>In contrast, the Tower Hamlets barrister presented arguments containing information and explanations that were not published at the time of the decision. They also argued that the Mayor of Tower Hamlets was free to go against the Mayor of London's transport strategy and Local Implementation Plan - a submission which was strongly contested by both the SOSS legal team and the Transport for London barrister.
								</p>
								<p>Now we need to wait weeks, or possibly months, for the judgment to be handed down. We hope the judge finds in our favour on at least one of our seven grounds of challenge. The judgment could lead to the quashing of the decision to rip out the Bethnal Green LTN. There would then be a chance to ask Tower Hamlets Council to work with us and the wider community on a better process for keeping and improving our safer streets.
								</p>
								<p>We are deeply thankful to all our generous supporters who made our momentous days in court possible.

								The time has come for us to head to the High Court for our judicial review hearing! On 20 and 21 November, a judge will hear why we think Lutfur Rahman’s decision last September to rip out our safer streets was illegal.
							</h4>
							<p>Our lawyers from Leigh Day will be arguing on seven grounds, including that the mayor ignored government guidance on low traffic neighbourhoods, ran a flawed consultation and decision-making process, and failed to properly consider if removing the LTN’s safer street layouts was a good use of £2.5 million.
							</p>
							<p>Representatives from Transport for London, an ‘interested party’, will be in court with us and have submitted evidence in advance. They are arguing that Tower Hamlets’ decision didn't follow the necessary legal processes and is at odds with the council’s Local Implementation Plan which had previously been agreed with the Mayor of London.
							</p>
							<p>If the judge decides that any of our seven grounds are proven, then the mayor’s decision is likely to be cancelled. We hope this will lead Tower Hamlets Council to rethink their plans and focus on real local priorities. 
							</p>
							<p>We are so grateful to the thousands of you who have supported us so far and who donated to our crowdfunder to get us into the courtroom. We hope to come out with a result that helps protect our  cleaner air, safer routes and friendlier neighbourhoods for our community and beyond.
							</p>
							<p>Ricardo Gama, senior associate solicitor at Leigh Day, said:
							</p>
							<blockquote>"Lutfur Rahman committed in his election manifesto to following a legal consultation process before deciding whether to remove the safer street layouts in Tower Hamlets. The High Court will hear why the procedure which he and the council followed appears to have been anything but that. Our client argues that by failing to comply with the legal safeguards for local government decision-making, Mr Rahman and the council have ridden roughshod over the plurality of voices who live and work in Tower Hamlets, in particular the majority of households in the borough who don’t own a car."

								On Thursday 7th November, we submitted <a href="https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/protect-our-safer-streets-in-tower-hamlets">our petition</a> to protect Tower Hamlets' safer streets to the London Assembly. You can watch Assembly member Caroline Russell present it <a href="https://webcasts.london.gov.uk/Assembly/Event/Index/7ed445b3-c4c1-4b9b-9eb1-300f704dbf4b?in=2024-11-07T13%3A20%3A46.750Z&out=2024-11-07T13%3A21%3A54.930Z">here</a>.
							</h4>
							<p>We were thrilled that by the time the petition was presented it had over 3,500 signatures - testament to how many people care about safer streets in the capital. We now await a response from Sadiq Khan and will of course update you when we have news on this. We know he’s on our side on this issue, but it’s really important that he matches this support with action and does everything he can to prevent Tower Hamlets from taking this harmful action.
							</p>
							<p>Such strong support is really helpful in keeping this issue on Sadiq’s radar at a time when some key decisions are going to be made about transport in Tower Hamlets.
							</p>
							<p>The most immediate decision is our judicial review. The hearing is scheduled for November 20-21, where the High Court will decide if Tower Hamlets Council's decision to remove these schemes was lawful. While the case has been brought by a local resident and supported by SOSS, TFL are appearing as an interested party. This illustrates how important this decision is to London-wide transport and why the ask of our petition is such an important element in the campaign.
							</p>
							<p>Thank you to everyone who signed and shared the petition. We are so grateful for your support. Check back for updates or <a href="./index.html#contact">sign up to our newsletter</a> to stay in the loop.

								We are launching a petition asking Mayor Sadiq Khan to stand up for Londoners and
								residents of Tower Hamlets by stepping in to prevent the removal of the LTNs in Tower
								Hamlets. If necessary, we are asking him to use his legal powers to do this.
							</h4>
							<p>We believe Sadiq Khan could and should be doing more to stand up for the many Londoners
								who want to keep our safer street schemes. Tower Hamlets Council’s plans go against all
								his transport policies at a time when he risks not hitting his own targets. Evidence
								also shows that the majority of Londoners support LTNs and other measures that make
								streets friendlier and safer for people who walk, cycle and use public transport. And we
								know that Sadiq has legal powers as Mayor of London that would allow him to intervene
								where a council does something that goes against the transport plans for London.
							</p>
							<p>Petitions to the Mayor of London need to be presented by an Assembly member. The great
								news is that Caroline Russell, a Green London Assembly member, has agreed to present a
								petition for us.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>We only have one month</strong> to gather as many signatures as possible to show
								Sadiq that people care about this and want him to do more. Please <a
									href="https://go.saveoursaferstreets.org/petition-ws">sign the petition today</a>
								and share with as many people as you can -- friends, neighbours, WhatsApp groups,
								socials. This is an issue that goes beyond Tower Hamlets so people can sign in support
								wherever they live in the UK..
							</p>
							<p>
								We’ll also be doing some campaigning on the ground. If you’d like to put an A3 poster up
								in your window, <a href="mailto:info@saveoursaferstreets.org">get in touch</a> and we’ll
								get one to you.

								Some of you have asked if there is a way to support the campaign financially, and now
								there is a way for you to do this!
							</h4>
							<p>With the exception of the CrowdJustice appeal, we’ve taken an ad hoc approach to funding
								our activities to date. Steering Group members have often covered the cost of print runs
								etc., or occasionally we’ve had a whip-round on WhatsApp. This has meant we have been
								limited in our scope and funding bigger one-off costs has been tricky.
							</p>
							<p>We’ve exciting plans for the year ahead and to make sure we can maximise the impact of
								our actions, we’ve set up a new way for you to donate to the campaign – either by making
								a one-off donation or by becoming a regular supporter.We've always been a
								community-driven campaign and our approach to fundraising will be accountable, open and
								democratic.
							</p>
							<p>
								We’re working with Social Change Nest who support grassroots groups like ours. They make
								sure all the money is properly handled and accounted for, and their platform allows
								donors to choose which activities to support and keep track of what the campaign is
								spending money on. We think it’s great and you can check out our new campaign page (and
								make a donation) <a
									href="https://opencollective.com/save-our-safer-streets-tower-h/projects/community-organiser/donate">here</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								All the money you give will be used to fight to save our safer streets and to build the
								campaign. It will help ensure we get lasting and permanent change in Tower Hamlets. And
								as well as giving to us, if you have ideas for campaigning activity we could be doing,
								you are welcome to let us know and get involved in how we spend the money.

							<h4 class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								Today we have two pieces of exciting news to share. Firstly, the courts have told us
								that our hearing for judicial review will take place at the <strong>Royal Courts of

								This is how the funds will be spent:

							<ul>
								<li>Our legal team should now have all the funds they need to prepare for the hearing,

									we lose.</li>
								<li> If our legal team ends up with any unspent money once all their work on the hearing
									and its immediate consequences is complete, then two examples of possible uses for
									leftover money from this stage would be:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>
										If we win: to seek legal advice on the implications of the judgment on the
										council’s future decision-making and any potential appeal from the council.
									</li>
									<li> If we lose: to go towards advice on a potential appeal.
									</li>
								</ul>

							<p class="w3-medium">
								The timeline up to the hearing on June 12 and 13 is as follows:
							</p>
							</h3>
							<p class="w3-medium">
							<ul>
								<li>
									By 22 March, Tower Hamlets Council and Transport for London (who joined the case as
									an Interested Party) should send the court their detailed legal submissions plus any
									evidence they want to rely on.
								</li>
								<li>
									By 12 April, we have to submit any submissions and evidence we need in reply.

								<li>
									By 14 May, we need to agree all the contents of the hearing bundle with Tower

								We will have a two-day hearing at the High Court.
							</h4>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								A judge has decided that all of our seven reasons for challenging Tower Hamlets Mayor’s
								decision can be argued in court. Having read all the paperwork from us and Tower Hamlets
								Council, a judge agreed with our legal team that all of our grounds of challenge are
								arguable, and disagreed with the council’s arguments that the whole case should be
								dismissed without a hearing. This is a big step forward.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Here's what happens next:
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
							<ul>
								<li>Tower Hamlets Council and Transport for London (who joined the case as an Interested
									Party) now have a month to send the court their detailed evidence.</li>
								<li>We will then have a few weeks to submit our own detailed evidence in reply.</li>
								<li>In the coming weeks, we should also find out the date for the hearing, which we
									expect to be in the first half of 2024.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Here is what this means in detail:
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>We will get a chance to argue in court that the decision made in September
										2023 to remove the LTNs in Bethnal Green was unlawful.</strong> Judges turn down
									the
									vast majority of claims for judicial review at this “paper submission” stage, or at
									least they reject many of
									the grounds of challenge. The facts of our case and the way our excellent legal team
									have presented them, mean we have cleared the hurdle at the first attempt and been
									granted a full hearing directly, rather than needing a preliminary hearing.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Our overall funding target is now £75,000 (not the original
										£80,000).</strong>
									Our legal team had advised us to assume a £10,000 cap to cover the legal costs of
									Tower Hamlets
									council in case we lose. But because the Council didn’t ask to amend the cap,
									the “Aarhus Convention” is going to apply with a £5,000 limit.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>TfL will also be getting involved.</strong> TfL has brought in Charlotte
									Kilroy KC to represent their position as an “interested party” at the hearing.
									Again, this is a
									signal that our challenge matters beyond just our local area. TfL doesn’t spend
									money on lawyers to
									intervene in dodgy or very local legal cases.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>At some point in 2024 (or 2025) there will be a High Court judgment on
										whether Lutfur Rahman, Mayor of Tower Hamlets, broke the law.</strong>
									If the judge decides that any of the seven grounds are proven, then their decision
									is likely to be cancelled. We hope
									this will lead to a fundamental rethink by the Council, rather than them just
									deciding again
									to remove the low traffic neighbourhoods in the borough.
								</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Ultimately, our vision is to save our safer streets, by keeping and improving the good
								infrastructure that we have. The legal challenge is one very important piece of the
								puzzle but we have plans for a whole lot more. Watch this space for more information

							<h4 class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								Today at Save our Safer Streets, we have applied to the High Court to ask a judge to
								review whether Mayor Lutfur Rahman broke the law when he decided in September to remove
								our safer streets.
							</h4>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								We believe the Tower Hamlets Mayor has failed to follow the law in several ways,
								including ignoring government guidance on low traffic neighbourhoods, running a flawed
								consultation and decision-making process, and failing to properly consider if removing
								the safer streets design is a good use of £2.5 million.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Our group of residents has been campaigning since summer 2022 to keep the schemes in
								place. Jane Harris from the group said:
							</p>
							<blockquote>"This legal challenge is an absolute last resort for us. We have tried for a
								year and a half to meet the mayor and look at the specific issues and solutions for
								Bethnal Green, but he hasn’t even bothered to visit the scheme, let alone meet us."
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								"Not only has he ignored all the evidence, expert views and residents’ preferences about
								keeping the schemes, but he has now made a decision which we believe has broken the
								law.""
							</blockquote>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Harris notes that the outcome of the case will have an impact far beyond Tower Hamlets.
								Transport for London, which has previously recommended that the schemes stay in place,
								has already become involved in the legal case as an ‘interested party’ – something it
								has declined to do in other similar cases, such as the recent judicial review into
								the removal of a cycle lane on High Street Kensington.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								"No council has ever removed a permanent low traffic neighbourhood that has the support
								of a majority of residents," continues Harris. "If this decision were to be deemed
								legal, it would set a terrible precedent. It would be a huge blow for healthy, safe
								travel across the country."
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								The SOSS campaign – along with local schools, the Royal London Hospital and the police –
								has emphasised the benefits of the Tower Hamlets safer streets schemes, underscored by
								the results of three resident consultations which all came out in support of keeping the
								cycle lanes, seating areas for residents and wider pavements.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">“Our community benefits so much from the cleaner air and quieter
								residential streets,” says Harris. “In the course of this campaign I’ve heard so many
								stories from families, disabled people, delivery cyclists, businesses and neighbours who
								all love feeling safer and breathing easier. The changes have made our neighbourhood so
								much friendlier. Going back to heavy traffic would be really destructive.”
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								The campaigners have instructed Leigh Day Solicitors to act on their behalf. Senior
								associate solicitor Ricardo Gama said:
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								"Save Our Safer Streets feel they have no option but to bring a claim for judicial
								review because the mayor has chosen the most destructive option of completely removing
								the low traffic neighbourhoods when less harmful alternatives were available, and the
								evidence showed that the schemes were working."
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								"A judge will now decide whether the grounds of challenge are arguable and if so, a full
								hearing will be held in 2024. In the meantime, we have asked the council to confirm that
								they won’t carry out any works to remove the schemes until the court has decided whether
								the mayor acted legally."
							</blockquote>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Harris and her fellow campaigners are now crowdfunding to finance the legal challenge.
								“It’s a desperate measure, but we feel so strongly about this and the support we’ve had
								so far shows that many of our neighbours feel the same,” she says. “It’s heartening to
								see how much people want us to succeed.”

								Tower Hamlets residents, including campaigners, GPs and schools, have expressed their
								dismay at a decision by the council to remove almost the entirety of ‘Liveable Streets’
								schemes in the borough.

							</h4>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Two public consultations have shown strong local support for keeping the streets in
								Bethnal Green and Brick lane as they are. The results of the most recent consultation
								from February 2023, published last week, showed that 58% of local residents preferred
								the status quo, and over 75% of all respondents favoured keeping the current schemes.
							</p>

							<p class="w3-medium">
								Residents were offered two options in the consultation - Option 1 to reverse the low
								traffic neighbourhoods or Option 2 to keep them.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								The street layouts were installed just two years ago at a cost of over £2 million.
								Today’s decision will cost the council at least a further £2.5m and is not currently
								budgeted for. Bart’s Hospital, the Metropolitan Police, Transport for London, local
								schools, local GPs and 82% of businesses have all supported ‘Option 2’ or keeping the
								schemes as they are, given the improvements to health and safety and reductions in
								anti-social behaviour.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								<strong>Jane Harris, a campaigner with Save Our Safer Streets, who last year presented a
									petition signed by 3094 residents calling on the council to keep the
									layouts</strong>; requested
								to speak at this evening’s Cabinet meeting but was rejected. She said:
							<blockquote>“We are utterly
								dismayed by the Mayor’s reckless and dangerous decision today. He has shown absolute
								contempt for the health of children and older people in the borough. Every time they’ve
								asked local residents what we want, we’ve said the same thing: keep and improve the new
								layouts.</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“And now the council has decided to ignore what the majority of residents want and get
								rid of nearly all the improvements. This is totally undemocratic and unacceptable. It
								will take us back to the bad old days of unsafe roads, polluted air and really
								problematic anti-social behaviour in areas like Arnold Circus and Middleton Green. And
								he’s offering us nothing at all to mitigate any of these issues.</blockquote>
							<blockquote>“We’re also very concerned about the report they based the decision on. We
								noticed it
								leaves out a huge amount of the evidence we’ve seen in favour of the schemes, including
								objections from the Met Police and Transport for London, and it misrepresents the views
								of local businesses.</blockquote>
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								<strong>Dr Emma Radcliffe, a GP and Vice Chair of the Tower Hamlets Local Medical
									Council</strong>, is
								one of 65 health professionals who have written to the mayor urging him to preserve the
								schemes and their associated health benefits. She said:
							<blockquote>“Keeping the schemes is
								absolutely the best thing for public health in the borough. The council’s data shows
								that air quality is improving everywhere in Tower Hamlets, but pollution is still a big
								threat to our health. We also know that active travel is associated with better physical
								and mental health, as well as lower environmental impact.</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“In a borough with the fifth worst air quality in London as well as higher rates of
								childhood obesity and early death from stroke and heart disease, we need to do
								everything possible to reduce dependency on cars and get people walking and cycling.
								That’s why my colleagues and I called on the mayor to retain the schemes.”</blockquote>
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								<strong>Simon Ramsay is the head of Oaklands School on Old Bethnal Green Road</strong>,
								in the middle of
								one of the low traffic neighbourhoods. He said:
							<blockquote> “I’m absolutely appalled by this
								decision. The current street layouts have made our 1,000 students so much safer as they
								come and go and travel between our buildings: now they’ll be at risk again. The thought
								of thousands of extra cars, vans and HGVs chugging past our school, spewing pollution
								and endangering our young people, is truly awful.</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“The huge disruption and noise required to reverse the schemes, not to mention the
								incredible waste of public money here is truly galling. The mayor recently paused a
								desperately needed investment programme for our school, and we will have to watch as he
								ploughs money into ripping up the infrastructure around our school that made it a better
								place to work and study.</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“We see first-hand the impact of the housing and cost-of-living crises on our community,
								and we’re about to see rubbish piling up due to strikes. But the Mayor wants to spend at
								least £2.5m pulling out a scheme that only recently cost millions of taxpayers' pounds
								to put in.”</blockquote>
							</p>

							<p class="w3-medium">
								<strong>Rob Andari from Save Our Safer Streets</strong> said:
							<blockquote> “All along we’ve asked the

								TOWER HAMLETS: Papers published ahead of a decision next week (20 Sept) on the future of
								the Liveable Streets scheme have revealed that 58% of local residents want to keep the
								new road layouts in place.
							</h4>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								The latest council report also shows that air quality has improved both within the
								scheme and on boundary roads.
							</p>

							<p class="w3-medium">
								The cabinet papers make public the results of a consultation carried out in February -
								the second in less than a year. Both consultations have found that residents support the
								status quo. The more detailed 2019 consultation that inspired the scheme also reported
								strong resident support for the Liveable Streets schemes. However, the 2021 Aspire
								manifesto committed to reversing them.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Mayor Lutfur Rahman and his Cabinet will decide on the future of the schemes next
								Wednesday. Alongside the two options offered to residents in the consultation - Option 1
								to reverse the schemes or Option 2 to keep them - the papers also include a new option
								which has been developed by the council behind closed doors.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Under option 3, over 80% of the scheme removals proposed by option 1 would still be
								carried out, at an estimated cost of £1.2m which is not currently in the council budget.
								Bart’s Hospital, the Metropolitan Police, Transport for London, local schools and 90% of
								businesses have all supported ‘option 2’ or keeping the schemes as they are, given the
								improvements to health, safety and anti-social behaviour.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								If the council decided to remove the schemes, it would be the first in the country to do
								so against the will of residents.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Rob Andari from local campaign group Save Our Safer Streets said: “Residents have
								repeatedly rejected option 1. It’s pretty safe to assume they wouldn’t welcome a
								decision that delivers 81% of the outcome they didn’t want, under this new, unconsulted
								third option 3.
							</p>

							<p class="w3-medium">
								“Lutfur Rahman promised to be a ‘listening Mayor’ - here is his chance to come good on
								that promise. At least 58% of residents have said they want to keep the current street
								designs and save the council more than a million pounds.
							</p>

							<p class="w3-medium">
								“We would love the council to spend that money on things Tower Hamlets residents really
								need like better housing, more funding for schools and more help during the cost of
								living crisis. It would be an insult to residents to ignore what they’ve said a third
								time and to spend their money making the air dirtier and making cycling and walking more
								dangerous at a time when people need cheap forms of transport more than ever.
							</p>

							<p class="w3-medium">
								“Last year, more than 3,000 local people <a
									href="https://democracy.towerhamlets.gov.uk/mgEPetitionDisplay.aspx?ID=184&RPID=58550332&HPID=58550332"
									target="_blank">signed a petition</a> calling on the council to stop, listen and
								improve its plans. They haven’t stopped, they aren’t listening and they have proposed no
								improvements to what we already have today.”

						</div>

							<h4 class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								Jane Harris, a local resident and campaigner, explains why the Bethnal Green and Weavers
								LTNs work well for the local community, in response to Rishi Sunak's latest comments.
							</h4>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Rishi Sunak has ordered a review of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) and implied that
								they are a destructive force in towns and cities across the UK. But from here in Tower
								Hamlets, allegedly one of the more divided areas on this issue, the opposite is actually
								true.
							</p>

							<p class="w3-medium">
								A clear majority of Tower Hamlets residents have consistently said they support walking
								and cycling infrastructure whenever we are asked in consultations - and this is despite
								new mayor Lutfur Rahman’s position that he has to “reopen the roads” to fix the borough.
								However, two separate consultations in 2019 and 2022 have failed to support this idea.
								While politicians can successfully treat roads as a wedge issue around elections, when
								people see or experience the reality of safer streets, they see the benefits as
								significantly outweighing any downsides.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								It’s important to recognise that LTNs inherently rely on local specifics - how the
								traffic filters, planted areas, bike lanes and seating work with the grain of a
								community. It’s not possible to say that all LTNs are good or bad, much like it’s
								meaningless to say that all buildings are good or bad. If they are well designed, then
								our experience in Tower Hamlets is that they can transform thousands of lives for the
								better, by making it a safer and friendlier place for walking, cycling and meeting up
								with friends and neighbours outdoors.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								In Tower Hamlets, it is especially important to think of everyone rather than just car
								drivers. Only one third of households in the borough have access to a car, which is
								amongst the lowest levels of car access in both London and the country. The borough has
								some of the highest levels of deprivation in the UK, and there is a significant number
								of people who earn their living as delivery cyclists.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								In a cost of living crisis, we have to help people to use the cheapest forms of
								transport - cycling, walking, the bus and tube. The public don’t want to see their money
								wasted on removing street infrastructure which could instead be invested in important
								priorities such as education, health and housing. And why should the safety of hundreds
								or thousands of people earning a living as delivery cyclists in east London be pitted
								against the convenience of private hire drivers?
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Getting neighbourhood-level changes to streets right is not easy. There are numerous
								different lives and uses to balance. However, it is important that national and local
								governments support schemes which encourage more people to walk and cycle, and to use
								their cars less. Every time someone chooses an active or more sustainable option for
								their journey, they are reducing congestion for those who need to drive, they are
								improving their own and their neighbours’ health and they are helping to foster a safer
								and friendlier community.
							</p>

							<p class="w3-small w3-text-gray">
								Jane Harris is a local resident and campaigner with two young children and a disabled
								husband who uses a wheelchair. The family have seen their lives immeasurably improved by
								low traffic neighbourhoods in a deprived area of Tower Hamlets where they live, and Jane
								is campaigning to stop mayor Lutfur Rahman returning heavy traffic to the Bethnal Green
								streets.

							<p class="w3-medium">
								Since we came together as a group last summer, one of our biggest concerns has been
								about the way the Liveable Streets consultations have been run by Tower Hamlets Council
								- both the recent one in February and the one conducted last summer.
							</p>
							<p>
								This week, we sent a report to the Tower Hamlets mayor, his cabinet and senior officers,
								laying out the problems we have found with how the recent Liveable Streets consultations
								were run.
							</p>
							<p>
								The report was accompanied by an open letter summarising our findings, which was
								co-signed by the London Cycling Campaign, Oaklands School, Tower Hamlets Wheelers and
								over 400 locals.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our report lays out how the conduct of the council has fallen short of the Aspire
								manifesto pledges at every stage since the May 2022 elections. We explain how their
								consultation process prevents them from fairly canvassing all views:
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Key stakeholders</strong> - Residents and interested parties such as
									schools, TfL, Bart’s
									Health Trust and the Met Police, have objected to the mayor’s proposals and have not
									been listened to.</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Multiple consultations</strong> - Re-consulting with the same proposal
									undermines trust in
									the democratic process.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Bias and confusion</strong> - Information presented to the public has been
									extremely
									one-sided, downplaying the benefits of the current layouts and exaggerating the
									benefits of “reopening the roads”. The second consultation overloaded people with
									confusing graphs, unreadable plans and the consultation period was so short that it
									left insufficient time to ensure clarifications could be sought.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Process</strong> - Many people have been excluded from the process due to
									the lack of
									warning, in-person events and confusing documents. The way that ‘unique survey
									reference numbers’ have been relied on by the council means that hundreds of local
									voices have been discounted from the headline presentation of survey results.

								SOSS campaign discovers hundreds of local residents’ views were excluded from LBTH
								Council’s consultation report
							</h4>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Today we issued a <a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/missing-votes">press release and
									data
									sheet</a> that show Tower Hamlets Council didn't include hundreds of local
								residents’ responses in its analysis of last summer’s Liveable Streets consultation.
							</p>
							<p>
								Removing these responses significantly changed the outcome of last year’s survey,
								which
								was only revealed when the council launched the second consultation in January.
							</p>
							<p>
								The information we have now received in response to an FOI request shows that over
								400
								resident responses in the Bethnal Green area and over 200 residents’ responses in
								the
								Weavers area were excluded from the data the council published as “local responses”.
								This meant that up to 28% of local residents’ views were disregarded in the
								council’s
								analysis for some areas.
							</p>
							<p>
								The responses were excluded because they didn’t use the code from the paper
								consultation
								packs, even though their postcodes should have been enough to identify them as
								‘local’.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our analysis shows that when these residents’ responses are included, the results
								reveal
								significantly stronger support for keeping the current street layouts.

								<a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/tower-hamlets-council-misrepresent-tfl-position-liveable-streets-ltns/"

								Liveable Streets.
							</p>
							<p>
								This has recently come to light through a Freedom of Information request in which TfL
								Strategy Officer Alex Williams writes, in a letter to Tower Hamlets Council:
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								“[W]e firmly support retention of the LTN on Old Bethnal Green Road. We have offered
								funding and resources to progress further bus priority measures on Hackney Road, to
								address any impacts caused by the LTN."
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								By contrast, the council claimed that TfL supported removal of the LTNs, claiming delays
								to busses on Hackney Road. Campaigners are concerned that this could have imapcted the
								consultation results.

							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>Dear Mayor Rahman,</p>

								<p>
									We the undersigned are all headteachers of the schools located within the Old
									Bethnal Green Road and Weavers “Liveable Streets” schemes and we would therefore
									be severely impacted by the proposals the council published on 19 January.
								</p>

								<p>
									We have experienced Bethnal Green before the new street layouts and after. And
									it is clear to all of us that the recent changes to our local streets have
									brought about significant improvements to the safety and health around our
									schools.
								</p>

								<p>
									Before, the immediate area around our schools was dominated by speeding
									vehicles, noise and fumes.  Now, we can see from the data provided that there
									has been a significant reduction in cars using the roads around our schools and
									that this has positively affected air quality.
								</p>

								<p>
									From the summer 2022 consultation results that you have recently published, we
									can see that support for the changes is a majority view in Bethnal Green and
									Tower Hamlets as a whole.
								</p>

								<p>
									Are the current schemes perfect? Surely not. Can they be improved? Yes, we think
									so.
								</p>

								<p>
									Ofsted requires us to identify and mitigate threats to children’s health and
									safety and the proposals are a threat to safe arrival and departure from school.
									Ofsted also requires us to communicate with stakeholders and this is why we are
									speaking out to make our position on this issue clear.
								</p>

								<p>
									That is why we are deeply concerned by the proposals you have published at the
									start of a three-week consultation process. You haven’t put forward any options
									for improving the schemes by building on what we currently have. Instead, you
									are presenting a choice between reopening roads such as Old Bethnal Green Road
									to more than 6,000 vehicles per day or keeping the layouts as they are.
								</p>

								<p>
									You are furthermore confusing matters by saying that schools such as ours will
									only be able to benefit from improved pedestrian crossings if the current street
									layouts are removed. Why should we have to choose between a safe, low-traffic
									area for our students and a zebra crossing outside our school? Controlled
									crossings in sensible places would significantly improve the current layouts,
									without the need to re-introduce thousands of dangerous and polluting vehicles
									every day around our schools.
								</p>

								<p>
									Please reconsider your proposal and work with us and other stakeholders and the
									wider community on a third option, which accepts that the current layouts are
									popular and successful, but could be better. Don’t go back to square one. Look
									to improve what is already there. You are very welcome to meet us at one of our
									schools and walk around the neighbourhood to find out more for yourself.
								</p>

								<p>Yours Sincerely</p>

								We urge residents to “see through council’s greenwash” and
								<a href="https://talk.towerhamlets.gov.uk/liveablestreets" target="_blank">vote to keep
									the current street layouts</a>.
							</h4>
							<p>
								We at Save Our Safer Streets are shocked and disappointed at a
								<a href="https://talk.towerhamlets.gov.uk/liveablestreets
									target=" _blank">consultation launched by Tower Hamlets Council</a>
								(19 Jan ‘23) on the future of Liveable Streets schemes - six months after a
								previous consultation on the same proposals.
							</p>

							<p>
								The results of the last consultation, which have not been published until now,
								show wide-ranging support for the current street layouts.
							</p>

							<p>
								We urge residents who support the low traffic schemes to see through the flawed
								and very misleading text in the new documents and vote for
								<strong>Option 2</strong> - to keep the new layouts. Option 1, to remove the
								schemes, amounts to blatant greenwashing.
							</p>

							<p>
								It's good that the new consultation document contains evidence which was missing
								in the last one, but it also contains many baseless claims. For example, it
								claims that ripping out both dedicated cycle lanes and quieter, traffic-free
								social spaces will encourage people to walk, cycle and socialise, as long as the
								council also puts in a few plants and a handful of new crossings and three
								dropped kerbs. This is nonsense. Who will cycle or walk more or sit on a
								solitary bench with 6,000 more cars thundering along Old Bethnal Green Rd?
							</p>

							<p>
								We're pleased the council have included some of the clear evidence that the
								schemes are working. Their data shows that the new layouts have improved our
								neighbourhoods, reducing traffic across the area by 9,700 vehicles a day and
								introducing better, safer, walking and cycling routes. Residents living near the
								schemes supported all the current measures except one. Across the borough,
								support for the schemes was overwhelming.
							</p>

							<p>
								Despite this positive data and clear local support, the Mayor and council are
								choosing to ignore the first consultation and the
								<a href="https://democracy.towerhamlets.gov.uk/mgEPetitionDisplay.aspx?ID=184&RPID=58550332&HPID=58550332"
									target="_blank">second biggest petition ever in the borough</a>. They are trying
								yet
								again to push their same old idea - one that will cost
								millions of pounds.
							</p>

							<p>
								The council’s suggested changes will have a wide impact, putting at risk
								much-needed improvements to Hackney Road including a proposed new bus lane which
								Transport for London have said can only be put in if the current street layouts
								remain.
							</p>

							<p>
								So far the Mayor has ignored our repeated requests to work together respectfully
								to find ways to keep what is successful in the area and build on that. We
								believe the best solution is to listen to local people, keep the current layouts
								and make smaller, cost-effective changes if necessary.
							</p>

							<p>
								Again, we urge the people of Bethnal Green to look beyond the false claims from
								the council and not be overwhelmed by the details in the 20-page document. As
								residents we need to show we still care about our streets being healthier,
								friendlier and safer for children, disabled and older people and all of us.
								<a href="https://talk.towerhamlets.gov.uk/liveablestreets" target="_blank">Choose Option
									2 – to keep the schemes</a>. This is the only way
								to
								avoid wasting a lot of money and taking our
								neighbourhood back to the noisy, unhealthy and unfriendly past.

								We’re so proud of what we achieved in the meeting but very disappointed by the

								councillors.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
								Our petition asked the council not to rush ahead with its plan to “reopen the
								roads”, but listen to community voices, experts and data before making decisions
								more likely to “please almost everyone”.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">

							<img src="media/oaklands_students_TH_council_meeting.jpg"
								class="w3-image w3-margin-bottom w3-round lazy"
								alt="Image from Roman Road London webpage." />

							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
								Inside, speakers for the petition, acting on our behalf, were Simon Ramsay,
								headteacher of Oaklands School in Bethnal Green, Jane Harris, a carer for her
								disabled husband, and Shaheena Parvin, a mother of five and Aspire voter, who
								spoke movingly of the way the new street layouts have transformed life for her
								family – especially her four-year-old autistic son.
							</p>

							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">After the meeting, Jane Harris said:</p>
							<blockquote>
								“I was so proud of the three of us this evening – and of the 50 supporters who
								came all the way to the Town Hall on a rainy weeknight to show how much they
								want safer, healthier, friendlier streets. We had taxi drivers, school children,
								a real mix of ages and ethnicities, staging a peaceful and colourful
								demonstration.
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“Our group has worked hard for months to show the council how people really feel
								about the street schemes. We’ve met with councillors, sent them an 900-signature
								open letter, submitted one of the borough's biggest ever petitions and a range
								of stories about the benefits of the schemes for a diverse range of residents.
								We’ve drawn their attention to letters from schools, Barts Health and TfL. We’ve
								even published our own data analysis, assembled through FoI requests. They also
								have the results of their own consultation, which they haven’t shared.
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“We hoped that ‘the mayor who listens’ would take all this evidence on board and
								actually engage with us, instead of just talking about listening. This was a
								great opportunity for him to alter his approach.
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“It was extremely disappointing, to have our efforts belittled and dismissed by
								Aspire councillors who seemed not to have heard anything we have been saying.
								Their response to us all along has amounted to stonewalling. They are still
								choosing to repeat unfounded claims about issues with the schemes and never
								mentioning the real benefits. We’re still none the wiser about timelines or
								decisions about our streets.”
							</blockquote>

							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
								Jane said that a minority of councillors did show willingness to engage.
							</p>

							<blockquote>
								“We were really pleased that Councillor Asma Islam for Labour tabled a motion
								which supported many of our asks,” she said. “She said this shouldn’t be a party
								political issue. But Councillor Kabir Ahmed’s speech, for Aspire, was more
								focused on scoring political points than addressing the valid concerns of
								thousands of his constituents. He belittled and dismissed us. This was extremely
								partisan political behaviour.
							</blockquote>

							<blockquote>
								“We came away shocked by his lack of any respect for the 3,094 people who have
								signed our petition. Why is Aspire so stuck in the past, instead of working to
								improve things now and for the future?”
							</blockquote>

							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
								We heard later in the meeting, Mayor Rahman announce that he would be keeping
								the Wapping bus gate, citing “<a
									href="https://twitter.com/LutfurRahmanTH/status/1577742488655241217"
									target="_blank">evidence and responses to public opinion surveys.</a>”
							</p>

							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">Responding to this, Jane continued:</p>

							<blockquote>
								“We are pleased about the bus gate, but we’re incredulous to hear that he based
								his decision on evidence and consultation results when he still hasn’t published
								any. This doesn’t feel like a listening approach to us.
							</blockquote>

							<blockquote>
								“There's a long way to go. We’ll know the mayor is really listening when he and
								his councillors respond to our campaign asks and acknowledge what so many people
								keep trying to tell them – that these schemes have massive benefits.”
							</blockquote>

							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">

								Responding to Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman’s
								<a href="https://twitter.com/LutfurRahmanTH/status/1575178336640241664">statement</a>
								at the cabinet meeting on 28 September, Simon Ramsay, headteacher of Oaklands
								School on Old Bethnal Green Road, said:
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
									“There was some positive new information in the Mayor’s announcement, such as a
									commitment to ‘grasp all the issues affecting our residents on both sides of the
									debate’. However, we are disappointed to hear him repeat many unproven claims
									about the impacts of the new street layouts. It’s frustrating that he didn’t
									share the results of the recent consultation either, six weeks after it
									finished.
								</p>
								<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
									“Our petition, signed by over 3,000 locals, asked him to take the time to
									listen. He says that he will, and we hope this means he will truly take all
									views on board.
								</p>
								<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
									“If he were to listen, he would hear from many people right across the community
									whose lives are made better by the new streets,
									<a href="https://heartbg.uk/stories.html" target="_blank">as we have</a>. He
									would hear, as our own painstaking research shows, that air quality is now
									better across all of Tower Hamlets than it was in 2019 and that the changes
									haven’t had a significant impact on traffic on boundary roads.
								</p>
								<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
									“If he were to listen, he would note the
									<a href="https://foi.tfl.gov.uk/FOI-1142-2223/LR%20Tower%20Hamlets%2028072022_Redacted.pdf"
										target="_blank">letter he received from TfL</a>
									which said that if he ripped out the Old Bethnal Green Road design, this ‘...
									would prevent TfL introducing a bus priority scheme on Hackney Road as cyclists
									who currently benefit from the scheme would be forced back to use that road.’
								</p>
								<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
									“We were glad to hear the mayor talk about his commitment to net zero emissions
									and to working with the community to encourage people to move away from car use
									towards public transport and active travel. We strongly support these aims, but
									we’re baffled that he thinks they could be compatible with removing the street
									improvements that help people to walk and cycle.
								</p>
								<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
									“The mayor says he will provide updates on this issue ‘in due course’. A good
									opportunity would be 5 October, when the council will debate the
									<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/petition" target="_blank">petition</a> I submitted
									to ‘Save our safer streets in Tower Hamlets’.
								</p>
								<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
									“We will be asking the council to publish evidence about the impact of street
									layout changes and release the results of the consultation, two months on from
									its closure. We are calling on them to allow time for a thorough process that
									looks at any specific issues that need to be addressed, with specific solutions,
									before reaching any decision.”

								This fantastic show of support smashes the council’s threshold of 2,000
								signatures – the number needed for them to hold a debate on the issues raised –
								and gives them an idea of just how many local people want them to take more care
								over the future of our streets.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								We owe this great campaign milestone to everybody who signed the petition and
								spread the word. Special thanks are due to those tireless volunteers who hit the
								streets with flyers, day after day, to make sure everyone in the neighbourhood
								heard about the council’s plans and got the chance to raise their voice.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large w3-text-black">THANK YOU EVERYONE!</p>
							<p>
								We hope the debate might lead to a process of listening and collaboration
								between the council and the community. But this is far from over, so please stay
								tuned to find out what the mayor announces this Wednesday, and to hear more
								about the council debate on Wednesday 5 October.

								Today we can say with some confidence that
								<b>Save Our Safer Streets is having an impact on Tower Hamlets council</b>.
							</p>
							<p>
								In August, the council approved its strategic plan, which said that it would
								decide to “reopen the roads” in September and then rush to implement that
								decision in October. The council was publicly committed to rushing through its
								proposals.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Today we know that their decision on “reopening the roads” is NOT going to be
									pushed through in September.</b>
								It is on the agenda for the 28 September 2022 cabinet meeting as an
								announcement, which means that no decision is going to be made.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								<b>OUR CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER BEAR FRUIT</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								Our <em>Save Our Safer Streets</em> activities in August and September have
								contributed to this change of heart by the council:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									A whole cross-section of Tower Hamlets residents have written to the mayor and
									his councillors, gone along to surgeries and shared their stories online, using
									their voices to show all the different ways that the new street layouts have
									benefitted them and their families.
								</li>
								<li>
									2,600+ people who live, work or study in Tower Hamlets have signed the petition
									started by Simon Ramsay, headteacher at Oaklands School on Old Bethnal Green
									Road, calling on the council to stop, listen and improve the new street layouts
									rather than rush to remove them. This is the highest petition currently on the
									Tower Hamlets website and the second highest in its history!
								</li>
								<li>
									And more than 220 people have donated over £16,000 to the CrowdJustice campaign,
									which is funding a potential legal challenge to the flawed process the council
									is currently pursuing.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								<b>WHAT DOES THIS DELAY MEAN?</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								This delay to the council’s plan is a meaningful win for our campaign – in fact
								you could say that we are a step closer to achieving step 1 of our petition:
							</p>
							<blockquote class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								1. We
								<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/petition" target="_blank">petition the council to STOP
									plans to scrap the new street layouts</a>
								so there is time to reach a justified decision.
							</blockquote>

							<p class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								<b>SO WHAT’S NEXT?</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								We now know the mayor will make an announcement, rather than a decision, about
								Liveable Streets at the cabinet meeting on 28 September, and we’ll be watching
								closely to see what he says. We would expect him to talk about the results of
								the consultation and share more information about his timetable.
							</p>
							<p>
								We can’t be sure what the announcement will be, but we now have some time to
								move on to the other parts of our petition, starting with step 2:
							</p>
							<blockquote class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								2. We ask the council to LISTEN to residents, businesses, schools and service
								providers across our diverse community to understand the benefits of the new
								street layouts, as well as any issues.
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								A thorough debate at the 5 October full council meeting will be a good start, so
								that all our elected representatives can share their views. It is thanks to
								everyone’s efforts that there are enough signatures on the petition to trigger
								the debate.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are preparing our plans for the 5 October meeting of the full Council and we
								look forward to the discussion and debate that follows. We hope that the council
								meeting is the beginning of an ongoing dialogue with the council which could
								culminate in step 3 of our petition:
							</p>
							<blockquote class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								3. We want to find ways to IMPROVE, not hastily remove the new street layouts.
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								We have always said we would much rather work with the council, stakeholders and
								the whole community to come up with ways to improve what we have, rather than
								challenge any unlawful decision through the courts.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								<b>THERE’S PLENTY MORE TO DO – SO STAY IN TOUCH</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								We would like to thank everyone who is contributing to this campaign. Stay
								posted with what’s happening over on
								<a href="https://twitter.com/SaveBGstreets">Twitter</a> and
								<a href="https://www.instagram.com/sossbethnalgreen/">Instagram</a> – and please

								<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/crowdjustice-web">CrowdJustice page</a> if they
								want to show their support for keeping and improving, rather than removing, the
								new street layouts in Tower Hamlets.

								<em>Almost £2million pounds has been spent on improving the streets in Bethnal

							</p>
							<p>
								The introduction of traffic calming, green spaces, and seating areas, designed
								to reduce traffic and pollution in Bethnal Green, has cost £1.834 million of
								Tower Hamlets Council's money (this doesn't include any project-wide costs spent
								across the borough). Almost all this amount comes from capital funding that the
								council get from developers for community infrastructure projects (for a
								breakdown of figures, see freedom of information request Ref.

							<p>
								This council money, that belongs to everyone who lives in Tower Hamlets, is
								meant to be used on permanent projects designed to improve our borough - new

								the council and residents won't get the money back; it will be wasted. It will
								also cost more money to put things back the way they were.
							</p>
							<p>
								Let's not remove the improvements to our streets and waste this money! We want
								Tower Hamlets Council to consult with residents, businesses and schools to see
								what can be done to further improve our roads for all.

								<a href="https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.23568" target="_blank">academic article</a>
								(Goodman, Laverty, Thomas & Aldred 2021) shows that fire engine response times
								are not being adversely effected by <em>Low Traffic Neighbourhoods</em> (LTNs).
							</p>
							<p>
								The article - by academics from Westminster, Imperial and the School of Hygiene
								and Tropical Medicine - presents a study of fire engine response times in and
								around LTNs in London. The work focuses specifically on LTNs introduced in 2020
								including in our borough, Tower Hamlets. The findings from the research show
								that there is no evidence to suggest LTNs have increased overall response times.
								This result applies in central, inner and outer London and whether the LTN uses
								physical or camera enforced restrictions. Notably, the proportion of delayed
								'first engines' fell across all areas after the introduction of LTNs. In
								addition, reported delays 'due to traffic calming' were "more than offset" by a
								fall in delays from traffic or roadworks.
							</p>
							<p>
								Research like this raises lots of questions for us in Tower Hamlets. It's still
								very early to know how low traffic neighbourhoods are impacting the emergency
								services in our borough but it's clear we really need to have free access to
								data, better understand the challenges and think collectively about ways
								forward.

								<strong>SAVE OUR SAFER STREETS</strong> believe the only way we can stop the
								reversal of the new green spaces and safer streets is to work together.
							</p>
							<p>
								We need to build a common voice to show we care about the high levels of
								pollution in Bethnal Green. Collectively, we need to take action to improve
								safety and the environment for all. What's really important is that this common
								voice is made up of as many people as possible from across the neighbourhood. We
								need to show Tower Hamlets Council that a significant majority of people want to
								build on the improvements that have been made to our streets.
							</p>
							<p>
								We believe that what we need is more experimentation with our streets; we need
								to allow our communities to find new ways to reduce pollution and to increase
								the number of green spaces where we can walk, talk and play.

								One of the first things to be aware of is that despite what many people are
								saying, the Tower Hamlets council do not have a mandate for reversing the new
								green spaces and safer streets. The new mayor and some new councillors from the
								Aspire Party did pledge to institute the reversal in the May local elections.
								However, the votes were not a full endorsement of this pledge. The Aspire party
								only won 36.95% of the total vote. Labour won 36.53% and the Green Party 9%, and
								both these parties supported Liveable Streets. It's also worth noting that only
								41.84% of the borough voted in the elections.
							</p>
							<p>
								It's clear that there's a lot to fight for and that many people will want a say
								on our new green spaces and safer streets.
