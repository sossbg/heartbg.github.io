                                The short clip from TV One's news programme shows how locals such as Abdul have come to see the value of the new road layouts. They aren't perfect, but they feel safer for parents. Rather than calling for them to be removed, there is support across the
                                community for working together to develop ways to improve them.

                            <p>Less than a third of households have a car in the borough. This is the lowest proportion of car ownership per household across London. And this proportion is falling faster than in other parts of London. There has been an 18%
                                decline in the decade since 2010.</p>
                            <p>This doesn't mean there are less cars on our roads. Tower Hamlets population is growing and, although car ownership as a proportion of the population is falling, total car numbers are going up.</p>
                            <p>This isn't a good situation: more cars, even more people, and all in the same densely populated space. We need to discourage driving and we have to put more thought into designing streets where people can walk, talk and play
                                safely.

                            <blockquote>"A lot of older people come out and sit here. When I explained the situation to them, they said 'No! They can't take this from us, it's not right! It's the only place we have to go when the weather is good.' That touches my

                            <p>Saciido moved to the area from Shoreditch seven years ago with her son, who is now at university and likes to play basketball on Middleton Green.</p>
                            <blockquote>"We don't have our own gardens. I come down here, I use my phone, I watch my son playing in the park. Sometimes the children come over here playing. I watch them and I say, 'Thank you God, at least we have this space.'<br>"And
                                now someone wants to come here and use it for cars and parking."</blockquote>
                            <p>Saciido says that Old Bethnal Green Road was 'horrible' before the changes.</p>
                            <blockquote>"There were a lot of cars here, it was noisy and dangerous for vulnerable people. Look at it now! I want to keep it like this. It's precious, like a diamond."</blockquote>

                            <p><em>Almost £2million pounds has been spent on improving the streets in Bethnal Green. These were improvements that 68% of those who responded to a consultation voted for (see freedom of information request Ref. <a href="https://towerhamletsportal.icasework.com/resource?id=D34833670&db=LKIVPdkPTgixWsHCc7lCNQ%3D%3D" target="_blank">33087276</a>).</em></p>
                            <p>The introduction of traffic calming, green spaces, and seating areas, designed to reduce traffic and pollution in Bethnal Green, has cost £1.834 million of Tower Hamlets Council's money (this doesn't include any project-wide
                                costs spent across the borough). Almost all this amount comes from capital funding that the council get from developers for community infrastructure projects (for a breakdown of figures, see freedom of information request
                                Ref. <a href="https://towerhamletsportal.icasework.com/resource?id=D34833670&db=LKIVPdkPTgixWsHCc7lCNQ%3D%3D" target="_blank">27521573</a>).</p>
                            <p>This council money, that belongs to everyone who lives in Tower Hamlets, is meant to be used on permanent projects designed to improve our borough - new streets, housing and the like. If the improvements in Bethnal Green are
                                removed, the council and residents won't get the money back; it will be wasted. It will also cost more money to put things back the way they were.</p>
                            <p>Let's not remove the improvements to our streets and waste this money! We want Tower Hamlets Council to consult with residents, businesses and schools to see what can be done to further improve our roads for all.</p>

                            <p>An <a href="https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.23568" target="_blank">academic article</a> (Goodman, Laverty, Thomas & Aldred 2021) shows that fire engine response times are not being adversely effected by <em>Low Traffic Neighbourhoods</em>                                (LTNs).</p>
                            <p>The article - by academics from Westminster, Imperial and the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - presents a study of fire engine response times in and around LTNs in London. The work focuses specifically on LTNs introduced
                                in 2020 including in our borough, Tower Hamlets. The findings from the research show that there is no evidence to suggest LTNs have increased overall response times. This result applies in central, inner and outer London
                                and whether the LTN uses physical or camera enforced restrictions. Notably, the proportion of delayed 'first engines' fell across all areas after the introduction of LTNs. In addition, reported delays 'due to traffic calming'
                                were "more than offset" by a fall in delays from traffic or roadworks.</p>
                            <p>Research like this raises lots of questions for us in Tower Hamlets. It's still very early to know how low traffic neighbourhoods are impacting the emergency services in our borough but it's clear we really need to have free
                                access to data, better understand the challenges and think collectively about ways forward.</p>

                            <p>Mehraj Alam, 45, who lives on Teesdale Street and runs a local business, has come to appreciate the changes to Old Bethnal Green Road.</p>
                            <blockquote>"I was livid when they first introduced it,"" he says. "I drive for work, and it's made that less convenient for me. But I have two kids at schools along this road and it has made the school run a much more pleasurable experience.
                                It's great to walk along there and see other families on the way to school, it feels a lot safer without the morning rush of cars. </blockquote>
                            <blockquote>"We've bought our eldest a bike to get to school now and it's nice to know he's not breathing so many fumes. I think it's not just good for our kids, but for kids in future years."</blockquote>
                            <p>Mehraj has some frustrations with the scheme, however, and some suggestions for improvements. He says what he really wants is for his voice to be heard.</p>
                            <blockquote>"I think we need to calm down a little and talk this through... We have to find a middle ground and work together. Just as we're getting used to the new street, they want to change it back, but they need to talk to us properly
                                first. It affects our daily lives, not theirs!</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>“What we need to do now is move forward as a community.”</blockquote>

                                the Council to slow down and listen to the whole community. Keep and improve rather than panic and remove!"</blockquote>

                            It's very hard to dispute the difference the changes the new green spaces and safer streets have made to our neighbourhoods. We've gone from streets often busy with cars to quieter and greener spaces; there is much less speeding, and walking and cycling
                            are safer.

                            <p>We believe that what we need is more experimentation with our streets; we need to allow our communities to find new ways to reduce pollution and to increase the number of green spaces where we can walk, talk and play.</p>

                            <p>One of the first things to be aware of is that despite what many people are saying, the Tower Hamlets council do not have a mandate for reversing the new green spaces and safer streets. The new mayor and some new councillors
                                from the Aspire Party did pledge to institute the reversal in the May local elections. However, the votes were not a full endorsement of this pledge. The Aspire party only won 36.95% of the total vote. Labour won 36.53%
                                and the Green Party 9%, and both these parties supported Liveable Streets. It's also worth noting that only 41.84% of the borough voted in the elections.</p>
                            <p>It's clear that there's a lot to fight for and that many people will want a say on our new green spaces and safer streets.</p>
