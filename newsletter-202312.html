                            and Old Bethnal Green Road. We are doing this as a last resort to keep our cycle lanes,

                    <p class="w3-medium">
                        We're taking the council to court because we think they broke the law when they decided in
                        September to rip out our safer streets. We have tried every other way we could think of to
                        get them to rethink this decision. We asked to meet the Mayor - he didn't even visit the
                        area to see the cycle lanes, pocket park, planters or new pavements. We collected 3094
                        signatures on a petition. We spoke at council meetings. We organised demonstrations outside
                        the council offices. We have done everything other than legal action. If you want the safer
                        streets to stay, the only option now is to <a
                            href="https://go.saveoursaferstreets.org/crowdfunder-nl">back this legal fight</a>.

                    <p class="w3-medium">
                        If we lose this case and the council goes ahead, we will lose:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cycle lanes along Old Bethnal Green Road - instead this will become a 2 way street with
                            6000 more cars every day</li>
                        <li>The extra pavement area outside the Birdcage where people can sit outside in summer and
                            musicians perform - this will become a 2 way street again</li>
                        <li>planters in Arnold Circus that keep late night car bars out</li>
                        <li>Safe crossings for the 1000+ children at schools throughout the area </li>
                        <li>Seating around Middleton Green where people of all ages gather and chat </li>
                        <li>Cleaner air for everyone in the scheme and on the boundary roads </li>
                        <li>At least £2.5million of public money, which could be spent on better housing, schools
                            and help in the cost of living crisis. </li>

                    <h2>The specifics of the case</h2>
                    <p class="w3-medium">
                        We think the Mayor went against the law in many ways when he decided in September to rip
                        out safer streets. We believe that, amongst other things, he:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ignored Government guidance on Low Traffic Neighbourhoods </li>
                        <li>Failed to consider if ripping this out is a good use of £2.5m</li>
                        <li>Followed a flawed consultation and decision-making process</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="w3-medium">
                        So we're asking for a judge to review this decision or in other words a 'judicial
                        review'. At this stage we are just asking if a judge will hear the case. If they agree
                        it's worth reviewing, that would likely happen some time in 2024. A very experienced law
                        firm called Leigh Day and a leading barrister called David Wolfe KC are helping us to
                        take the case.

                        <li>Make the case to the court that a judge should look at this case</li>

                        Over the year and a half we've been running this campaign, thousands of people have
                        spoken up in support of keeping our safer streets.

                        <li>3094 people signed our petition</li>
                        <li>At least 58% of local residents and 80% of local businesses asked the council to
                            keep safer streets in the consultation earlier this year</li>
                        <li>The local NHS Trust and GPs said they want to keep the scheme to protect everyone’s
                            health</li>
                        <li>The local police said the scheme should stay to reduce anti-social behaviour and
                            improve road safety</li>
                        <li>Transport for London told the council they should keep the scheme to make it easier
                            to walk, wheel and cycle and to enable public transport improvements on Hackney Road
                            - and then withheld funding from the council. </li>
                        <li>86 local schools wrote to the council asking them to listen and prioritise
                            children's health and safety.</li>
                        <li>This amount of support shows we are fighting for a hugely important cause. We just
                            need to keep going - and now the courts are our best and only chance of keeping our
                            safer streets.</li>

                            Ask a local shop to put up a poster or put one up in your flat or house if it's
                            visible
                            from the street. We've been to lots of local businesses already. But if you know
                            someone
                            who hasn't got one up, please tell us and we can get a poster to you to give to
                            them.
