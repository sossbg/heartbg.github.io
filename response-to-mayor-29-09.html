							Responding to Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman’s
							<a href="https://twitter.com/LutfurRahmanTH/status/1575178336640241664">statement</a>
							at the cabinet meeting on 28 September, Simon Ramsay, headteacher of Oaklands
							School on Old Bethnal Green Road, said:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								“There was some positive new information in the Mayor’s announcement, such as a
								commitment to ‘grasp all the issues affecting our residents on both sides of the
								debate’. However, we are disappointed to hear him repeat many unproven claims
								about the impacts of the new street layouts. It’s frustrating that he didn’t
								share the results of the recent consultation either, six weeks after it
								finished.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								“Our petition, signed by over 3,000 locals, asked him to take the time to
								listen. He says that he will, and we hope this means he will truly take all
								views on board.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								“If he were to listen, he would hear from many people right across the community
								whose lives are made better by the new streets,
								<a href="https://heartbg.uk/stories.html" target="_blank">as we have</a>. He
								would hear, as our own painstaking research shows, that air quality is now
								better across all of Tower Hamlets than it was in 2019 and that the changes
								haven’t had a significant impact on traffic on boundary roads.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								“If he were to listen, he would note the
								<a href="https://foi.tfl.gov.uk/FOI-1142-2223/LR%20Tower%20Hamlets%2028072022_Redacted.pdf"
									target="_blank">letter he received from TfL</a>
								which said that if he ripped out the Old Bethnal Green Road design, this ‘...
								would prevent TfL introducing a bus priority scheme on Hackney Road as cyclists
								who currently benefit from the scheme would be forced back to use that road.’
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								“We were glad to hear the mayor talk about his commitment to net zero emissions
								and to working with the community to encourage people to move away from car use
								towards public transport and active travel. We strongly support these aims, but
								we’re baffled that he thinks they could be compatible with removing the street
								improvements that help people to walk and cycle.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								“The mayor says he will provide updates on this issue ‘in due course’. A good
								opportunity would be 5 October, when the council will debate the
								<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/petition" target="_blank">petition</a> I submitted
								to ‘Save our safer streets in Tower Hamlets’.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								“We will be asking the council to publish evidence about the impact of street
								layout changes and release the results of the consultation, two months on from
								its closure. We are calling on them to allow time for a thorough process that
								looks at any specific issues that need to be addressed, with specific solutions,
								before reaching any decision.”
							</p>
