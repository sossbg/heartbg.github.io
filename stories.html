								Former journalist Nooraini Mydin has lived in the East End for 17 years. She was
								"disgusted" to hear about the decision to remove low traffic schemes in the borough.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								“I moved to Bethnal Green from Bow in 2021. When I went out exploring the
								area, I stumbled upon Old Bethnal Green Road and, oh my God, what a beautiful place!”
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								When Nooraini heard that the mayor had decided to remove all the new road layouts, she
								was sad and angry.</p>
							<p>
							<blockquote>
								“It breaks my heart to think they would spend millions on ripping it all up and opening
								it to traffic. Especially at a time when councils are cash strapped and
								councils are starting to go bankrupt.</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“I can't believe they would rip up the pavements. How stupid! It is totally
								irresponsible. I can handle it if they decide not to create any other safe streets
								(which is stupid enough) but to waste the money already spent and incur further cost
								ripping them up, is totally idiotic.”
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Nooraini is hoping to see people come together from across the community to fight for
								the local environment.</p>
							<blockquote>
								“I hope some of our Muslim community can try and knock some sense into them (the
								council). I speak as a practising Muslim and I am disgusted. People might
								want to vilify me for speaking my mind like this but I'm sorry, I believe protecting
								this earth and saving lives is also our duty as Muslims.</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“Let's fight this together, folks. Black, brown, white, yellow, or green. It doesn't
								matter. This is OUR Bethnal Green. We must see the bigger picture.”

							<p>
								I’m a delivery cyclist. You’ve probably seen a few of us in East London, but not many
								people know what this job is like.
							</p>
							<p>
								I’m doing it so I can take a break after University. Using your brain drains you -
								sometimes you just want to relax. Uni was hard work but getting a job is even harder, so
								I wanted to earn some money without too much stress.</p>
							<p>
								But it is tough. I already got hit once in Farringdon by a late night driver. I was
								crossing a green signal and out of nowhere he just came up and hit me. He just kept on
								moving and didn’t stop. I fell on the side of the road and hurt my back.</p>
							<p>
								If you have reckless drivers all over the place, as a cyclist you can’t do much about
								it. But if there are cycle lanes, you don’t need to swerve in front of a car,
								potentially getting yourself hit. They make sense.</p>
						</div>

							<img src="media/story_11.JPG" class="w3-image w3-margin-top lazy"

						</div>
						<div class="w3-col s12 w3-medium">
							<p>
								There are also so many potholes, it’s unbelievable. On a busy day, we’re literally
								carrying around 30kgs. If you keep bumping on the road, the weight is literally hitting
								on your lower back. It’s very annoying and very inconvenient.</p>
							<p>
								Most of the bus stops are a bit damaged because of the weight of the bus when it stops
								there. Even though that’s a small area, the damage can spread all over the road. One of
								my close friends quit last week because he has to have surgery on his lower back. He’s
								23.</p>
							<p>
								The cycle lanes are smooth because they barely carry enough weight to damage the
								concrete or asphalt. It’s nice, you feel like you’re in your own space. You’re safe,
								you’re just riding. You go into your next stop without any issues. It’s what you need to
								do your job.</p>
							<p>
								I just found out that Tower Hamlets council wants to remove some of these cycle lanes.
								But everywhere else, they’re adding more bike lanes. Why would you take them away? I
								wonder if they’ve ever met a delivery rider.</p>
							<p>
								If politicians remove bike lanes, they’re putting riders’ lives at risk. It feels like
								they don’t care about us. A lot of people doing this job are just about getting by. Why
								would politicians want to make our lives even more difficult and less safe? It just
								doesn’t make sense. You have to keep bike lanes. They’re good!

						<div class="w3-col s12 w3-medium">
							<p>Nimao says her neighbourhood now feels closure to nature.</p>
							<blockquote>
								"I grew up on a farm in Somalia, so the natural world really resonates with me.
								I love London, but let’s face it – we are living with a lot of pollution here.
								It’s great to be able to take my kids to the nature reserve. When we first moved
								here in 2017 it felt like an escape from the city. When you’re inside, it feels
								like there is more oxygen, you can connect with yourself.
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								"I used to start worrying about traffic the second I stepped out of the gate to
								go home. But now there are fewer cars on the road it feels really safe, and you
								can bring the feeling of the nature reserve with you out into the park. It feels
								connected, like a jigsaw. The atmosphere is more relaxed."
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								And it’s not just the connection to nature that makes life better for Nimao. She
								says the community is friendlier, too.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								“Sometimes I sit out there on the chairs, watching my kids in the park, and you
								meet so many neighbours that way. I hadn’t done that before. There are often old
								people sitting out there – Bengali, Somali, white… they just want to talk and
								connect. It’s kinda nice that they can share their experience. It’s amazing to
								hear their stories."
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Nimao sees the street schemes as an important part of wider climate action.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								"The environment is such a massive worry. When they changed the street, I felt
								hopeful, because it seemed like some real action at community level to do
								something about the environment. It gave me hope for my children – for their
								journey to school as they grow up, and for the planet they live on.
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“If they change it back to how it was, it would be horrible. A nightmare. I just
								think we need to think about the children and the younger generation. The city
								has to change."

							<blockquote>
								"We moved to Bethnal Green in 2019, just before the changes happened. It was

								Maisha's youngest brother is autistic, which means he is particularly sensitive
								to loud noise and sometimes struggles with road safety.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								"My brother was very little and we used to avoid going out on the Pundersons
								Gardens side because it was too hard to keep him safe. As well as the speeding
								cars there would be big crowds hanging around, which felt really intimidating."
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								And even at home Maisha's family couldn't escape the noise of the traffic.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								"Our garden is right next to the road. When we first moved in, the sound of car
								engines was really loud. I think they did it to show off. But my brother
								couldn't cope with the noise. He would scream and cry and come in the house - he
								couldn't even play in his own garden."
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								The family tried noise cancelling headphones but Maisha's brother found it
								easier just to stay inside. That all changed when Pundersons Gardens was closed
								off, however.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								“The difference it has made to our quality of life is enormous. We can sleep
								better, my brother is calmer in his own home, and we all feel safe on the roads
								around our house.”
							</blockquote>
							<p>Maisha says she would be devastated to see the road re-open.</p>
							<blockquote>
								"I think you'd need a really strong argument to open it and I haven't heard one.
								I find it quite extreme to talk about ripping out all the closures. I think
								there are other solutions that could be put in place rather than scrapping
								everything. It doesn't have to be rushed - any changes should be discussed with
								the whole community."

								The 50-year-old lift engineer says he was “proud” to be able to tell friends who
								used to live in his 19-storey block about how different the building and the

								night by loud music coming from cars.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								"I kind of didn’t realise what we were putting up with before, all the

							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Spencer says he’s a car owner himself, but his habits have changed as he has
								become more aware of the climate crisis.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									I’m concerned about it, 100%. I went for a car with a smaller engine because of
									the environment and I’ve started to give myself brownie points every time I
									don’t use it. In London, we’ve got the best transport you can imagine. We’ve got
									trains and buses coming out of our ears. What more could you want?
								</p>
								<p>
									"People need to look at the bigger picture. If we reverse this [scheme], we’re
									gonna have cars everywhere. This is a very dense area. If everyone had a car,
									the roads just aren’t big enough. You have to do something, or in the end, every
									road would be packed."
								</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								A longer car journey is a small price to pay for the improvements to the area,
								Spencer thinks.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								"It actually makes me happy when Hackney Road is busy, because it’s a sign that
								there’s less traffic on the side roads. It’s a move in the right direction."
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Spencer realises not everyone shares his opinion, but says that among his
								neighbours, even those who find the changes inconvenient, they can still see
								some of the benefits.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								"They might be annoyed that they’ve got to wait longer for a taxi, or drive a
								bit further, but overall, they would much rather it stays like this because they
								like the peace and quiet."
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								With the long summer evenings, Spencer finds he can appreciate his beloved
								neighbourhood more than ever.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								"After work, I’ve been sitting out in Arnold Circus. Those buildings are so
								beautiful, unique architecture. I used to think it was an insult to them, all
								those cars blaring their loud music. But now I can sit there to unwind and it’s
								just lovely, so much more pleasant. “I’ve always loved the East End. It’s my

								"I bring my children through Old Bethnal Green Road every weekend and I like how

							</blockquote>
							<p>
								This isn't a good situation: more cars, even more people, and all in the same
								space. What's clear is we need to discourage driving and we have to put more
								thought put into designing streets where people can walk, talk and play safely.

							<blockquote>
								"We don't have our own gardens. I come down here, I use my phone, I watch my son

								and I say, 'Thank you God, at least we have this space.'<br />"And now someone
								wants to come here and use it for cars and parking."

								Saciido says that Old Bethnal Green Road was 'horrible' before the changes.

							<blockquote>
								"There were a lot of cars here, it was noisy and dangerous for vulnerable

							</blockquote>
							<p>What she really wants to see is people working together.</p>
							<blockquote>
								"We love our area, the good and the bad. Tower Hamlets is a nice borough. If we

								Mehraj Alam, 45, who lives on Teesdale Street and runs a local business, has

							<blockquote>
								"I was livid when they first introduced it,"" he says. "I drive for work, and
								it's made that less convenient for me. But I have two kids at schools along this
								road and it has made the school run a much more pleasurable experience. It's
								great to walk along there and see other families on the way to school, it feels
								a lot safer without the morning rush of cars.
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								"We've bought our eldest a bike to get to school now and it's nice to know he's
								not breathing so many fumes. I think it's not just good for our kids, but for
								kids in future years."
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Mehraj has some frustrations with the scheme, however, and some suggestions for
								improvements. He says what he really wants is for his voice to be heard.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								"I think we need to calm down a little and talk this through... We have to find
								a middle ground and work together. Just as we're getting used to the new street,
								they want to change it back, but they need to talk to us properly first. It
								affects our daily lives, not theirs!
