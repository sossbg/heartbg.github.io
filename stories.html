									Nimao, a student midwife lives on Old Bethnal Green Road with her two daughters, and the family often visits Bethnal Green Nature Reserve and Middleton Green.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"The whole area feels so much safer. We’ve always loved being outside, but I used to feel anxious in the back of my mind all the time because of the cars whizzing by. It was always chocka-block with people driving into central London. But now I’m free of that worry. I can relax while they play football and run around. It’s absolutely lovely, I love it!"

									Nimao says her neighbourhood now feels closure to nature.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"I grew up on a farm in Somalia, so the natural world really resonates with me. I love London, but let’s face it – we are living with a lot of pollution here. It’s great to be able to take my kids to the nature reserve. When we first moved here in 2017 it felt like an escape from the city. When you’re inside, it feels like there is more oxygen, you can connect with yourself.
								</blockquote>
								<blockquote>
									"I used to start worrying about traffic the second I stepped out of the gate to go home. But now there are fewer cars on the road it feels really safe, and you can bring the feeling of the nature reserve with you out into the park. It feels connected, like a jigsaw. The atmosphere is more relaxed."
								</blockquote>
								<p>And it’s not just the connection to nature that makes life better for Nimao. She says the community is friendlier, too.</p>
								<blockquote>“Sometimes I sit out there on the chairs, watching my kids in the park, and you meet so many neighbours that way. I hadn’t done that before. There are often old people sitting out there – Bengali, Somali, white… they just want to talk and connect. It’s kinda nice that they can share their experience. It’s amazing to hear their stories."</blockquote>
								<p>Nimao sees the street schemes as an important part of wider climate action.</p>
								<blockquote>"The environment is such a massive worry. When they changed the street, I felt hopeful, because it seemed like some real action at community level to do something about the environment. It gave me hope for my children – for their journey to school as they grow up, and for the planet they live on.</blockquote>
								<blockquote>“If they change it back to how it was, it would be horrible. A nightmare. I just think we need to think about the children and the younger generation. The city has to change."</blockquote>

									Sam navigates the neighbourhood using a wheelchair. The improvements to the road

									"The closures have made life so much better for my family," says Maisha, the
									22-year-old teaching assistant who lives with her mother and four siblings in a
									house that backs on to Pundersons Gardens.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"We moved to Bethnal Green in 2019, just before the changes happened. It was
									horrible how cars used to speed up and down all day and all night. The noise
									made it hard to go to sleep at night and it was hard to cross the road during
									the day."

									Maisha's youngest brother is autistic, which means he is particularly sensitive
									to loud noise and sometimes struggles with road safety.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"My brother was very little and we used to avoid going out on the Pundersons
									Gardens side because it was too hard to keep him safe. As well as the speeding
									cars there would be big crowds hanging around, which felt really intimidating."
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									And even at home Maisha's family couldn't escape the noise of the traffic.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"Our garden is right next to the road. When we first moved in, the sound of car
									engines was really loud. I think they did it to show off. But my brother
									couldn't cope with the noise. He would scream and cry and come in the house - he
									couldn't even play in his own garden."
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									The family tried noise cancelling headphones but Maisha's brother found it
									easier just to stay inside. That all changed when Pundersons Gardens was closed
									off, however.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									“The difference it has made to our quality of life is enormous. We can sleep
									better, my brother is calmer in his own home, and we all feel safe on the roads
									around our house.”
								</blockquote>
								<p>Maisha says she would be devastated to see the road re-open.</p>
								<blockquote>
									"I think you'd need a really strong argument to open it and I haven't heard one.
									I find it quite extreme to talk about ripping out all the closures. I think
									there are other solutions that could be put in place rather than scrapping
									everything. It doesn't have to be rushed - any changes should be discussed with
									the whole community."

									The 50-year-old lift engineer says he was “proud” to be able to tell friends who
									used to live in his 19-storey block about how different the building and the
									area felt. As well as the sound of engines, he used to be disturbed late at
									night by loud music coming from cars.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"I kind of didn’t realise what we were putting up with before, all the
									background stress levels from the traffic noise."
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									Spencer says he’s a car owner himself, but his habits have changed as he has
									become more aware of the climate crisis.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										I’m concerned about it, 100%. I went for a car with a smaller engine because of
										the environment and I’ve started to give myself brownie points every time I
										don’t use it. In London, we’ve got the best transport you can imagine. We’ve got
										trains and buses coming out of our ears. What more could you want?
									</p>
									<p>
										"People need to look at the bigger picture. If we reverse this [scheme], we’re
										gonna have cars everywhere. This is a very dense area. If everyone had a car,
										the roads just aren’t big enough. You have to do something, or in the end, every
										road would be packed."
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									A longer car journey is a small price to pay for the improvements to the area,
									Spencer thinks.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"It actually makes me happy when Hackney Road is busy, because it’s a sign that
									there’s less traffic on the side roads. It’s a move in the right direction."
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									Spencer realises not everyone shares his opinion, but says that among his
									neighbours, even those who find the changes inconvenient, they can still see
									some of the benefits.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"They might be annoyed that they’ve got to wait longer for a taxi, or drive a
									bit further, but overall, they would much rather it stays like this because they
									like the peace and quiet."
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									With the long summer evenings, Spencer finds he can appreciate his beloved
									neighbourhood more than ever.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"After work, I’ve been sitting out in Arnold Circus. Those buildings are so
									beautiful, unique architecture. I used to think it was an insult to them, all
									those cars blaring their loud music. But now I can sit there to unwind and it’s
									just lovely, so much more pleasant. “I’ve always loved the East End. It’s my
									home. But now I think it’s the best it’s ever been.

									Mehraj Alam, 45, who lives on Teesdale Street and runs a local business, has
									come to appreciate the changes to Old Bethnal Green Road.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"I was livid when they first introduced it,"" he says. "I drive for work, and
									it's made that less convenient for me. But I have two kids at schools along this
									road and it has made the school run a much more pleasurable experience. It's
									great to walk along there and see other families on the way to school, it feels
									a lot safer without the morning rush of cars.
								</blockquote>
								<blockquote>
									"We've bought our eldest a bike to get to school now and it's nice to know he's
									not breathing so many fumes. I think it's not just good for our kids, but for
									kids in future years."
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									Mehraj has some frustrations with the scheme, however, and some suggestions for
									improvements. He says what he really wants is for his voice to be heard.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"I think we need to calm down a little and talk this through... We have to find
									a middle ground and work together. Just as we're getting used to the new street,
									they want to change it back, but they need to talk to us properly first. It
									affects our daily lives, not theirs!
								</blockquote>
								<blockquote>
									“What we need to do now is move forward as a community.”
