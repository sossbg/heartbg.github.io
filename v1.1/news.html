												The changes the council is proposing are in the name of helping car
												owners. Yet
												car owners do not make up the majority of those living in Tower Hamlets.
											</p>
											<p>
												Less than a third of households have a car in the borough. This is the
												lowest
												proportion of car ownership per household across London. And this
												proportion is
												falling faster than in other parts of London. There has been an 18%
												decline in
												the decade since 2010.
											</p>
											<p>
												This doesn't mean there are less cars on our roads. Tower Hamlets

												The nursery nurse and mother-of-one was "heartbroken" when she heard
												that her
												favourite seating spot on Old Bethnal Green Road might be taken away.
											</p>
											<p>
												She says her neighbours in the building just behind the communal area
												are
												equally upset.

											<blockquote>
												"Why do they want to remove this? They only put it in a year ago. I was

												shocked when I heard about the plans."

												She says her neighbours in the building just behind the communal area
												are
												equally upset.
											</p>
											<blockquote>
												"A lot of older people come out and sit here. When I explained the
												situation to
												them, they said 'No! They can’t take this from us, it’s not right! It’s
												the only
												place we have to go when the weather is good.' That touches my heart,
												because
												they are like my grandmas, you know?"
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												Saciido moved to the area from Shoreditch seven years ago with her son,
												who is
												now at university and likes to play basketball on Middleton Green.
											</p>
											<blockquote>
												"We don’t have our own gardens. I come down here, I use my phone, I
												watch my son
												playing in the park. Sometimes the children come over here playing. I
												watch them
												and I say, 'Thank you God, at least we have this space.'<br />"And now
												someone
												wants to come here and use it for cars and parking."
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												Saciido says that Old Bethnal Green Road was 'horrible' before the
												changes.
											</p>
											<blockquote>
												"There were a lot of cars here, it was noisy and dangerous for
												vulnerable
												people. Look at it now! I want to keep it like this. It’s precious, like
												a
												diamond."
											</blockquote>
											<p>What she really wants to see is people working together.</p>
											<blockquote>
												"We love our area, the good and the bad. Tower Hamlets is a nice
												borough. If we
												talk, listen, work together, we can improve things for our children. I’d
												tell
												the mayor, improve things, don’t destroy them! Don’t take this place
												away, leave
												it alone!"

												<em>Almost £2million pounds has been spent on improving the streets in

											<p>
												The introduction of traffic calming, green spaces, and seating areas,
												designed
												to reduce traffic and pollution in Bethnal Green, has cost £1.834
												million of
												Tower Hamlets Council's money (this doesn't include any project-wide
												costs spent
												across the borough). Almost all this amount comes from capital funding
												that the
												council get from developers for community infrastructure projects (for a
												breakdown of figures, see freedom of information request Ref.
												<a href="https://towerhamletsportal.icasework.com/resource?id=D34833670&db=LKIVPdkPTgixWsHCc7lCNQ%3D%3D"
													target="_blank">27521573</a>).
											</p>
											<p>
												This council money, that belongs to everyone who lives in Tower Hamlets,
												is
												meant to be used on permanent projects designed to improve our borough -
												new
												streets, housing and the like. If the improvements in Bethnal Green are
												removed,
												the council and residents won't get the money back; it will be wasted.
												It will
												also cost more money to put things back the way they were.
											</p>
											<p>
												Let's not remove the improvements to our streets and waste this money!
												We want
												Tower Hamlets Council to consult with residents, businesses and schools
												to see
												what can be done to further improve our roads for all.

												<a href="https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.23568" target="_blank">academic
													article</a>
												(Goodman, Laverty, Thomas & Aldred 2021) shows that fire engine response
												times
												are not being adversely effected by <em>Low Traffic Neighbourhoods</em>
												(LTNs).
											</p>
											<p>
												The article - by academics from Westminster, Imperial and the School of
												Hygiene
												and Tropical Medicine - presents a study of fire engine response times
												in and
												around LTNs in London. The work focuses specifically on LTNs introduced
												in 2020
												including in our borough, Tower Hamlets. The findings from the research
												show
												that there is no evidence to suggest LTNs have increased overall
												response times.
												This result applies in central, inner and outer London and whether the
												LTN uses
												physical or camera enforced restrictions. Notably, the proportion of
												delayed
												'first engines' fell across all areas after the introduction of LTNs. In
												addition, reported delays 'due to traffic calming' were "more than
												offset" by a
												fall in delays from traffic or roadworks.
											</p>
											<p>
												Research like this raises lots of questions for us in Tower Hamlets.
												It's still
												very early to know how low traffic neighbourhoods are impacting the
												emergency
												services in our borough but it's clear we really need to have free
												access to
												data, better understand the challenges and think collectively about ways
												forward.

												One of the first things to be aware of is that despite what many people
												are
												saying, the Tower Hamlets council do not have a mandate for reversing
												the new
												green spaces and safer streets. The new mayor and some new councillors
												from the
												Aspire Party did pledge to institute the reversal in the May local
												elections.
												However, the votes were not a full endorsement of this pledge. The
												Aspire party
												only won 36.95% of the total vote. Labour won 36.53% and the Green Party
												9%, and
												both these parties supported Liveable Streets. It's also worth noting
												that only
												41.84% of the borough voted in the elections.
											</p>
											<p>
												It's clear that there's a lot to fight for and that many people will
												want a say
												on our new green spaces and safer streets.

					<p>On the 21st July, TV One News visited Old Bethnal Green Road and spoke to two local residents,
						Abdul Woahid and a passer-by. Before the scheme went in they had some reservations but more
						recently they have come to appreciate
						the changes to the road.</p>

						<p></p>Abdul:<br> "First, we struggled with the road closures. There are four schools on this
						road. The risk was dropping kids off and picking them up.</p>
						<p>"After the closure, thank God, the drop-off and pick ups have become safer and this is better
							for us."</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Second resident:<br> Old Bethnal Green Road is much safer for the children and if the side
							roads can be opened that would help, and be better.
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<blockquote>
						<p>Abdul:<br>Improve the new roads but do not remove them. Leave Old Bethnal Green Road as it
							is. It's better - safer for us. Removing them will be costly for us, for Tower Hamlets
							Council.
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						The short clip from TV One's news programme shows how locals such as Abdul have come to see the
						value of the new road layouts. They aren't perfect, but they feel safer for parents. Rather than
						calling for them to be removed, there is support across the
						community for working together to develop ways to improve them.

					<p>The changes the council is proposing are in the name of helping car owners. Yet car owners do not
						make up the majority of those living in Tower Hamlets.</p>
					<p>Less than a third of households have a car in the borough. This is the lowest proportion of car
						ownership per household across London. And this proportion is falling faster than in other parts
						of London. There has been an 18%
						decline in the decade since 2010.</p>
					<p>This doesn't mean there are less cars on our roads. Tower Hamlets population is growing and,
						although car ownership as a proportion of the population is falling, total car numbers are going
						up.</p>
					<p>This isn't a good situation: more cars, even more people, and all in the same densely populated

						where people can walk, talk and play
						safely.

					<p>The introduction of traffic calming, green spaces, and seating areas, designed to reduce traffic

						doesn't include any project-wide
						costs spent across the borough). Almost all this amount comes from capital funding that the

					<p>An <a href="https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.23568" target="_blank">academic article</a> (Goodman,
						Laverty, Thomas & Aldred 2021) shows that fire engine response times are not being adversely
						effected by <em>Low Traffic Neighbourhoods</em> (LTNs).</p>
					<p>The article - by academics from Westminster, Imperial and the School of Hygiene and Tropical
						Medicine - presents a study of fire engine response times in and around LTNs in London. The work
						focuses specifically on LTNs introduced
						in 2020 including in our borough, Tower Hamlets. The findings from the research show that there
						is no evidence to suggest LTNs have increased overall response times. This result applies in
						central, inner and outer London
						and whether the LTN uses physical or camera enforced restrictions. Notably, the proportion of
						delayed 'first engines' fell across all areas after the introduction of LTNs. In addition,
						reported delays 'due to traffic calming'
						were "more than offset" by a fall in delays from traffic or roadworks.</p>
					<p>Research like this raises lots of questions for us in Tower Hamlets. It's still very early to
						know how low traffic neighbourhoods are impacting the emergency services in our borough but it's
						clear we really need to have free
						access to data, better understand the challenges and think collectively about ways forward.</p>

					<blockquote>"I think we need to calm down a little and talk this through... We have to find a middle

						back, but they need to talk to us properly
						first. It affects our daily lives, not theirs!</blockquote>

					<p><strong>SAVE OUR SAFER STREETS</strong> believe the only way we can stop the reversal of the new

					<p>We need to build a common voice to show we care about the high levels of pollution in Bethnal
						Green. Collectively, we need to take action to improve safety and the environment for all.
						What's really important is that this common

					<p>One of the first things to be aware of is that despite what many people are saying, the Tower
						Hamlets council do not have a mandate for reversing the new green spaces and safer streets. The
						new mayor and some new councillors
						from the Aspire Party did pledge to institute the reversal in the May local elections. However,
						the votes were not a full endorsement of this pledge. The Aspire party only won 36.95% of the
						total vote. Labour won 36.53%
						and the Green Party 9%, and both these parties supported Liveable Streets. It's also worth
						noting that only 41.84% of the borough voted in the elections.</p>
					<p>It's clear that there's a lot to fight for and that many people will want a say on our new green
