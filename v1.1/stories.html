									<p>"The closures have made life so much better for my family," says Maisha, the
										22-year-old teaching assistant who lives with her mother and four siblings in a
										house that backs on to Pundersons Gardens.</p>
									<blockquote>"We moved to Bethnal Green in 2019, just before the changes happened. It
										was horrible how cars used to speed up and down all day and all night. The noise
										made it hard to go to sleep at night and it was hard to cross the road
										during the day."</blockquote>

								<div class="w3-col s12 w3-medium">
									<p>Maisha's youngest brother is autistic, which means he is particularly sensitive
										to loud noise and sometimes struggles with road safety.
									</p>
									<blockquote>"My brother was very little and we used to avoid going out on the
										Pundersons Gardens side because it was too hard to keep him safe. As well as the
										speeding cars there would be big crowds hanging around, which felt really
										intimidating."</blockquote>
									<p>And even at home Maisha's family couldn't escape the noise of the traffic.</p>
									<blockquote>"Our garden is right next to the road. When we first moved in, the sound
										of car engines was really loud. I think they did it to show off. But my brother
										couldn't cope with the noise. He would scream and cry and come in the
										house - he couldn't even play in his own garden."</blockquote>
									<p>The family tried noise cancelling headphones but Maisha's brother found it easier
										just to stay inside. That all changed when Pundersons Gardens was closed off,
										however.</p>
									<blockquote>“The difference it has made to our quality of life is enormous. We can
										sleep better, my brother is calmer in his own home, and we all feel safe on the
										roads around our house.”</blockquote>
									<p>Maisha says she would be devastated to see the road re-open.</p>
									<blockquote>"I think you'd need a really strong argument to open it and I haven't
										heard one. I find it quite extreme to talk about ripping out all the closures. I
										think there are other solutions that could be put in place rather than scrapping
										everything. It doesn't have to be rushed - any changes should be discussed with
										the whole community."</blockquote>

									<p>“I've lived in the East End all my life, and this is the best thing that's ever
										happened to it,” says Spencer about the new road layouts.</p>

									<p>The 50-year-old lift engineer says he was “proud” to be able to tell friends who
										used to live in his 19-storey block about how different the building and the
										area felt. As well as the sound of engines, he used to be disturbed
										late at night by loud music coming from cars.
									</p>
									<blockquote>"I kind of didn't realise what we were putting up with before, all the
										background stress levels from the traffic noise."</blockquote>
									<p>Spencer says he's a car owner himself, but his habits have changed as he has
										become more aware of the climate crisis.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>I'm concerned about it, 100%. I went for a car with a smaller engine because
											of the environment and I've started to give myself brownie points every time
											I don't use it. In London, we've got the best transport you can imagine.
											We've got trains and buses coming out of our ears. What more could you want?
										</p>
										<p>"People need to look at the bigger picture. If we reverse this [scheme],
											we're gonna have cars everywhere. This is a very dense area. If everyone had
											a car, the roads just aren't big enough. You have to do something, or
											in the end, every road would be packed."</p>
									</blockquote>
									<p>A longer car journey is a small price to pay for the improvements to the area,
										Spencer thinks.</p>
									<blockquote>"It actually makes me happy when Hackney Road is busy, because it's a
										sign that there's less traffic on the side roads. It's a move in the right
										direction."</blockquote>
									<p>Spencer realises not everyone shares his opinion, but says that among his
										neighbours, even those who find the changes inconvenient, they can still see
										some of the benefits.</p>
									<blockquote>"They might be annoyed that they've got to wait longer for a taxi, or
										drive a bit further, but overall, they would much rather it stays like this
										because they like the peace and quiet."</blockquote>
									<p>With the long summer evenings, Spencer finds he can appreciate his beloved
										neighbourhood more than ever.</p>
									<blockquote>"After work, I've been sitting out in Arnold Circus. Those buildings are
										so beautiful, unique architecture. I used to think it was an insult to them, all
										those cars blaring their loud music. But now I can sit there to unwind
										and it's just lovely, so much more pleasant. “I've always loved the East End.
										It's my home. But now I think it's the best it's ever been.</blockquote>

									<blockquote>"Why do they want to remove this? They only put it in a year ago. I was

									<p>She says her neighbours in the building just behind the communal area are equally
										upset.</p>
									<blockquote>"A lot of older people come out and sit here. When I explained the
										situation to them, they said 'No! They can't take this from us, it's not right!
										It's the only place we have to go when the weather is good.' That touches my
										heart, because they are like my grandmas, you know?"</blockquote>
									<p>Saciido moved to the area from Shoreditch seven years ago with her son, who is
										now at university and likes to play basketball on Middleton Green.</p>
									<blockquote>"We don't have our own gardens. I come down here, I use my phone, I
										watch my son playing in the park. Sometimes the children come over here playing.
										I watch them and I say, 'Thank you God, at least we have this space.'<br>"And
										now someone wants to come here and use it for cars and parking."</blockquote>
									<p>Saciido says that Old Bethnal Green Road was 'horrible' before the changes.</p>
									<blockquote>"There were a lot of cars here, it was noisy and dangerous for
										vulnerable people. Look at it now! I want to keep it like this. It's precious,
										like a diamond."</blockquote>
									<p>What she really wants to see is people working together.</p>
									<blockquote>"We love our area, the good and the bad. Tower Hamlets is a nice
										borough. If we talk, listen, work together, we can improve things for our
										children. I'd tell the mayor, improve things, don't destroy them! Don't take
										this place
										away, leave it alone!"</blockquote>

									<blockquote>"I was livid when they first introduced it,"" he says. "I drive for

										experience.
										It's great to walk along there and see other families on the way to school, it
										feels a lot safer without the morning rush of cars. </blockquote>
									<blockquote>"We've bought our eldest a bike to get to school now and it's nice to
										know he's not breathing so many fumes. I think it's not just good for our kids,
										but for kids in future years."</blockquote>
									<p>Mehraj has some frustrations with the scheme, however, and some suggestions for
										improvements. He says what he really wants is for his voice to be heard.</p>
									<blockquote>"I think we need to calm down a little and talk this through... We have
										to find a middle ground and work together. Just as we're getting used to the new
										street, they want to change it back, but they need to talk to us properly
										first. It affects our daily lives, not theirs!</blockquote>

										The 50-year-old lift engineer says he was “proud” to be able to tell friends who
										used to live in his 19-storey block about how different the building and the
										area felt. As well as the sound of engines, he used to be disturbed late at
										night by loud music coming from cars.
									</p>
									<blockquote>
										"I kind of didn’t realise what we were putting up with before, all the
										background stress levels from the traffic noise."
									</blockquote>
									<p>
										Spencer says he’s a car owner himself, but his habits have changed as he has
										become more aware of the climate crisis.
									</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>
											I’m concerned about it, 100%. I went for a car with a smaller engine because
											of
											the environment and I’ve started to give myself brownie points every time I
											don’t use it. In London, we’ve got the best transport you can imagine. We’ve
											got
											trains and buses coming out of our ears. What more could you want?
										</p>
										<p>
											"People need to look at the bigger picture. If we reverse this [scheme],
											we’re
											gonna have cars everywhere. This is a very dense area. If everyone had a
											car,
											the roads just aren’t big enough. You have to do something, or in the end,
											every
											road would be packed."
										</p>
									</blockquote>
									<p>
										A longer car journey is a small price to pay for the improvements to the area,
										Spencer thinks.
									</p>
									<blockquote>
										"It actually makes me happy when Hackney Road is busy, because it’s a sign that
										there’s less traffic on the side roads. It’s a move in the right direction."
									</blockquote>
									<p>
										Spencer realises not everyone shares his opinion, but says that among his
										neighbours, even those who find the changes inconvenient, they can still see
										some of the benefits.
									</p>
									<blockquote>
										"They might be annoyed that they’ve got to wait longer for a taxi, or drive a
										bit further, but overall, they would much rather it stays like this because they
										like the peace and quiet."
									</blockquote>
									<p>
										With the long summer evenings, Spencer finds he can appreciate his beloved
										neighbourhood more than ever.
									</p>
									<blockquote>
										"After work, I’ve been sitting out in Arnold Circus. Those buildings are so
										beautiful, unique architecture. I used to think it was an insult to them, all
										those cars blaring their loud music. But now I can sit there to unwind and it’s
										just lovely, so much more pleasant. “I’ve always loved the East End. It’s my
										home. But now I think it’s the best it’s ever been.
