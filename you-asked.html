									<em>How we did the sums:</em><br />
									We looked at ambulance response times across Tower Hamlets and compared these to
									response times in the parts of the E2 postcode district which are covered by the new LTNs (including E2 0, E2 6, E2 7, E2 8 and E2 9).
									<p>
										For each area, we compared response times for like-for-like periods before and
										after the new road layouts, comparing December 2019-May 2020 and December
										2021-May 2022.
									</p>
									<p>
										We looked at ambulance responses to both category 1 (life-threatening) and
										category 2 (emergency) calls.
									</p>
									<p>
										For category 1 response times before and after the new road layouts the average
										response times fell by 38 seconds (compared to a fall of 37 seconds for Tower Hamlets as a whole). In other words, ambulance response times for
										category 1 (life-threatening) calls were, on average, lower after the new road layouts. The reductions were also comparable to the those across the borough as whole.

										Small print: The data we used for this analysis was supplied by the London Ambulance Service in response to a freedom of information request. The data presents average response times per month rather than response times to individual callouts. Thus, the analysis we've conducted must be seen as partial and conclusions provisional. However, the data available suggests the LTNs are not impacting ambulance response times. We'd welcome further detailed analysis from Tower Hamlets.

													<blockquote><p>"... a total of 9 incidents related to Liveable Streets Programme between 2019 and 2022  (hard physical closures/bollards) have been reported via DATIX (the Trusts incident reporting system).</p>
														
													<p>"Each of these incidents have been feedback [sic] to Tower Hamlets Council through meetings between the council and emergency services."</p>
													
													<p>Additionally as with all councils the London Ambulance Service NHS Trust formally wrote to Tower Hamlets in July 2020 to highlight concerns regarding around hard closures and the need for emergency vehicle ingress/egress to be properly considered. We have attached the letter for your assistance.</p>

[T]he bus gate you intend to remove at Wapping ... allows for faster and more reliable journeys on the route 100.

												To get a picture of congestion in Tower Hamlets and near to the borough’s new road layouts, we used data from Transport of London’s (TFL’s) bus journey times. Our analysis of bus journey times and other data provided by TfL shows that on Hackney Road and Bethnal Green Road, changes in journey times are in line with general trends. In other words, they don’t look different to other areas  in Tower Hamlets.
											</p>
											<p>
												Our analysis shows there has been a slight slowing of Eastbound traffic on Hackney Road with bus journey times increasing by 30 seconds, on average. This amounts to a less than 1mph reduction in traffic speeds. On Bethnal Green Road, there has been no discernible change. These results compare favourably to Whitechapel Road that is far from the new road layout schemes. Traffic on Whitechapel Road has become slower than either Hackney Road or Bethnal Green Road.
											</p>
											<p>
												Another trend is that journey times, having slowed in 2021/22, are now improving again. This points to a complicated picture of traffic on major boundary roads, where there are multiple causes to slow downs, including impact from nearby boroughs and regular roadworks.
											</p>
											<p>
												From these results, it’s not possible or credible to attribute the changes in congestion and traffic speeds on Hackney Road and Bethnal Green Road to Tower Hamlets’ new road layouts.
											</p>
											<p>
												<em>We're aiming to provide detailed analysis on congestion in Bethnal Green as soon as we can.</em>

												<b>London’s Walking & Cycling Commissioner from Transport for London (TfL), has written to the mayor of Tower Hamlets expressing concern for the borough's planned removal of the new road layouts. TfL views the new road layouts as integral to its objectives to promote active transport. In addition, the new roads were part funded by TfL and their removal, without full consultation, is against TFL's policies. If Tower Hamlets does remove the new road layouts it puts any future investment from TfL at risk.</b>

												London’s Walking & Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, from Transport for London (TfL) has written a letter to Tower Hamlets' mayor (dated 28 July 2022).</p>
												
												<p>He writes:</p>
													
													<blockquote>"I am concerned about the removal of [the "Liveable Streets"] schemes without that decision being supported by a full set of evidence, including how you are meeting your public sector equality duty. If these issues are not satisfied it may impact TfL’s decision on future funding for any schemes in Tower Hamlets."</blockquote>
													
												<p>He goes on to write:</p>
													
													<blockquote>"... the removal of some of these schemes will have a negative impact on bus services and quality of life.... [T]he bus gate you intend to remove at Wapping ... allows for faster and more reliable journeys on the route 100. Furthermore, removing the Old Bethnal Road scheme would prevent TfL introducing a bus priority scheme on Hackney Road as cyclists who currently benefit from the scheme would be forced back to use that road."</blockquote>

												<p><em>The short answer:</em><br />
												<b>Tower Hamlets' new road layouts are located in neighbourhoods with high social deprivation indicators.</b></p>
													
												<p><b>In the letters above, TfL and Bart's NHS Trust say they believe the removal of the new layouts could risk the "public sector equality duty". Executives from Bart's NHS Trust, for example, write that the "different and interconnected impacts" of the newly implemented schemes have been largely positive. They note that Tower Hamlets has very low car ownership and that pollution from cars has a disproportionate affect on the most vulnerable in our society. This would mean the removal of the new road layouts would impact those without cars and the vulnerable the most.</b></p>

									<div class="w3-col s12 w3-medium w3-text-black">
										<div class="w3-margin-bottom">
											<p>The recent introduction of traffic calming, green spaces, and seating areas in Bethnal Green alone, has cost £1.834 million of the Tower Hamlets Council's money (this doesn't include any project-wide costs spent across the borough). Almost all this money is Tower Hamlet's capital funding money that they get from developers specifically for <em>community infrastructure projects</em> (for a breakdown of figures, see freedom of information request <a href="https://towerhamletsportal.icasework.com/resource?id=D27360713&db=LKIVPdkPTgixWsHCc7lCNQ%3D%3D" target="_blank">Ref. 27521573</a>).</p>
											
											
											<p>This funding has benefitted the wider Tower Hamlets community. A published academic article (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692321002477" target="_blank">Aldred et al 2021</a>), surveying the relationship between Low Traffic Neighbourhoods and deprivation, shows that the mean deprivation inside Low Traffic Neighbourhoods in Tower Hamlets is 82%. This compares to the mean deprivation outside LTNs in the borough, which is 68%. Of the 21 boroughs surveyed, only Croydon and Westminster have greater disparities than this.</p>
											<p>Thus, the immediate benefits of the new road layouts in Tower Hamlets are for areas where deprivation levels are high. In other words, those with less are likely to feel the most immediate benefits of LTNs, such as less local pollution, more green spaces, and more areas to socialise and play.</p>
											<p>Attempts to reverse the new road layouts and ease car travel are likely to benefit the few in Tower Hamlets. The <a href="https://www.centreforlondon.org/reader/parking-kerbside-mangement/appendix-1/" target="_blank">Centre for London report</a> says only 32% of households in Tower Hamlets have a car at all, based on data from 2015 to 2017 (London Transport Demand Survey). That is the lowest of any London Borough.</p>
