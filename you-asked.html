							<b>Yes, and in a positive way. While air pollution levels have been falling in Tower Hamlets as a whole since 2015, the levels of NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide) within the area covered by the Bethnal Green Liveable Streets scheme have fallen faster than in the rest of the borough. </b><br /><br />
							<b>
							There is also no evidence that the scheme has negatively impacted air quality on the roads on the boundary of the scheme as a whole.

								<em>You asked:</em><br />

							</div>
							<div class="w3-margin-bottom">
								<em>The short answer:</em><br />
								<b>
									<p>
										Within the area of the LTN there has been a significant decrease in fatal and
										serious
										collisions relative to the rest of Tower Hamlets and other adjacent boroughs
										since
										the LTN opened.
									</p>
									<p>
										The level of serious and fatal collisions on boundary roads has stayed constant
										as has the level of collisions with slight injury both inside the LTN and on
										boundary roads.

									</p>
									Since the LTN has been introduced in July 2021, there has only been one serious
									collision in the area. This took place on the boundary of the LTN outside the area
									where the interventions and closures are in place. This is a significant improvement
									on the average of 2-3 collisions per year prior to the introduction of the LTN.

						<div class="w3-col m7 s12 w3-medium w3-text-black">
							<div class="w3-margin-bottom w3-margin-right">
								<em>How we did the sums:</em><br />
								We used data released by the Department of Transport that records all reports of road
								collisions with injury that are made to the police. We mapped this data onto the LTN
								area and identified incidents that happened within the area of the LTN, on boundary
								roads and outside the LTN area.
								<p>
									We then compared the number of road traffic collisions before and after the LTN was
									introduced. As a control we compared this to the rest of Tower Hamlets and
									neighbouring boroughs.

								</p>
								<p>
									Then we used a test known as the Boschloo's exact test to determine whether there is
									a statistically significant change in collision with respect to the control
									variable, we found that there was and this led us to conclude that the LTN had led
									to improvements in road safety.

									crime, specifically ASB related, and also increasing road danger”.</b>

								<p>The email notes that road accidents have <em>decreased</em> in the Wapping

									Drug-related crimes have also <em>decreased</em> on Old Bethnal Green Road

								</p>
								<p>Neighborhood Teams within the Met Police are in favour of the new road layouts.
									The team responsible for the Arnold Circus area states:
								</p>
								<blockquote> “I consider the road management measures that were brought in to have had a
									positive
									effect. I am surprised there is consideration to remove them. Of particular concern
									are
									the proposed amendments to the roads further West. Prior to the changes there was an
									enormous level of car-enabled ASB, drug dealing, NOx balloon usage etc which made
									life a
									misery for many of the residents in the streets around Arnold Circus and
									surrounding.
									This was due to the spill-out from the Shoreditch NTE. This has been dramatically
									reduced by the traffic management changes and forces those committing crime back
									onto
									the well-lit, CCTV covered main roads which are much easier for us to manage.”

								<p>
									For category 1 response times before and after the new road layouts the average
									response times fell by 38 seconds (compared to a fall of 37 seconds for Tower

								<em>You asked:</em><br />

								<p><em>The short answer:</em><br />

								</p>
								<div class="w3-col s12 w3-medium w3-text-black">
									<div class="w3-margin-bottom">
										<p>
											To get a picture of congestion in Tower Hamlets and near to the borough’s
											new road layouts we used data from Transport of London’s (TFL’s) bus journey
											times. Our analysis of bus journey times and other data provided by TfL
											shows that on Hackney Road and Bethnal Green Road, changes in journey times
											are in line with general trends. In other words, they don’t look different
											to other areas in Tower Hamlets.
										</p>
										<p>
											There is no evidence of any impact on journey times on Bethnal Green Road or
											Hackney Road Westbound from the LTNs. At the same time some other roads in
											the borough, such as Whitechapel Road, far from the LTN zone, have become
											slower than either of them.
										</p>
										<p>
											Between 2019 and 2022, there has been a slightly greater slowing in the
											speed of traffic on the Eastbound stretch of Hackney Road compared to other
											similar roads in Tower Hamlets. Even here, the data shows that <b>at most
												the journey time to cover the entire stretch of road has increased by an
												average of 30 seconds.</b>
										</p>
										<p>
											For several reasons, it is not possible or credible to attribute this slight
											slowing of traffic to the Tower Hamlets LTN. In particular, this Eastbound
											stretch of Hackney Road receives a lot of traffic from bordering Hackney,
											which has also brought in changes to traffic management in the same time
											period. Any analysis of changes in traffic flow would need to analyse the
											impact of those changes as well.
										</p>
										<p>
											Traffic patterns in Tower Hamlets have shifted around a great deal in the
											last couple of years for many reasons. Besides the installations of LTNs in
											Tower Hamlets we have seen several lockdowns, new ULEZ rules, and more cars
											on the roads across the borough than in 2019. None of the evidence we have
											seen supports the claim that congestion and delays in journey times have
											increased enough to justify reversing the LTNs – especially given the
											improvements in air quality across the borough.
										</p>
										<p>
											A <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/transparency/freedom-of-information/foi-request-detail?referenceId=FOI-1142-2223"
												target="_blank">letter</a> released to us through an FOI request to TfL
											also points out that reversing the changes on the Old Bethnal Green Road
											scheme, will potentially also have an impact on bus journey times and
											congestion on Hackney Road. In an official letter to Lutfur Rahman, dated 28
											July this year, Will Norman from TFL stated:
										</p>
										<blockquote>“...Removing the Old Bethnal Road scheme would prevent TfL
											introducing a bus priority scheme on Hackney Road as cyclists who currently
											benefit from the scheme would be forced back to use that road.”</blockquote>
										<p><b>In summary, there has been NO increase in journey times and delays on
												boundary roads attributable to the Tower Hamlets LTNs and the potential
												impact of removing the LTNs on bus travel and congestion could be a
												worsening of traffic conditions on those roads.</b></p>
										<p>
											<em>We're aiming to provide detailed analysis on congestion in Bethnal Green
												as soon as we can.</em>

									<p>The recent introduction of traffic calming, green spaces, and seating areas in
										Bethnal Green alone, has cost £1.834 million of the Tower Hamlets Council's
										money (this doesn't include any project-wide costs spent across the borough).
										Almost all this money is Tower Hamlet's capital funding money that they get from
										developers specifically for <em>community infrastructure projects</em> (for a
										breakdown of figures, see freedom of information request <a
											href="https://towerhamletsportal.icasework.com/resource?id=D27360713&db=LKIVPdkPTgixWsHCc7lCNQ%3D%3D"
											target="_blank">Ref. 27521573</a>).</p>


									<p>This funding has benefitted the wider Tower Hamlets community. A published
										academic article (<a
											href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692321002477"
											target="_blank">Aldred et al 2021</a>), surveying the relationship between
										Low Traffic Neighbourhoods and deprivation, shows that the mean deprivation
										inside Low Traffic Neighbourhoods in Tower Hamlets is 82%. This compares to the
										mean deprivation outside LTNs in the borough, which is 68%. Of the 21 boroughs
										surveyed, only Croydon and Westminster have greater disparities than this.</p>
									<p>Thus, the immediate benefits of the new road layouts in Tower Hamlets are for
										areas where deprivation levels are high. In other words, those with less are
										likely to feel the most immediate benefits of LTNs, such as less local
										pollution, more green spaces, and more areas to socialise and play.</p>
									<p>Attempts to reverse the new road layouts and ease car travel are likely to
										benefit the few in Tower Hamlets. The <a
											href="https://www.centreforlondon.org/reader/parking-kerbside-mangement/appendix-1/"
											target="_blank">Centre for London report</a> says only 32% of households in
										Tower Hamlets have a car at all, based on data from 2015 to 2017 (London
										Transport Demand Survey). That is the lowest of any London Borough.</p>
									<p>
										<em>We're aiming to provide detailed analysis on deprivation and its connection
